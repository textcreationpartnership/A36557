            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Be not diſmaid, if he lead you through the deſert to the Land of Promiſe, through Hell to Heaven: for that is his Native Countrey, whoſe paſſages he is well acquainted with; and from whoſe deſolate ſhades he is able to uſher you to the comfortable ſplendour of Paradiſe.

                  <hi>The Houſe of God is the thought of a Wiſeman.</hi> This Houſe the Eternal Wiſdome enters into, this it Inhabits, in this it ſweetly repoſes. To ſee, to ſpeak, to hear, to write, are humane actions, yet ſuch as are not wholly denyed to Brutes: for Wild-Beaſts do likewiſe hear and ſee, and herein ſome of them go far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond man himſelf. Amongſt Animals, ſome are reported to have ſpoken; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Elephant is aſcribed ſomething not unlike to writing: but to think and diſcourſe with reaſon, is proper to Man alone. God aſſociates himſelf to men
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29880:5"/>whoſe thoughts are Holy and without ſpot, and here he abides as in his own Manſion-houſe: hence flowed that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſaying of Philo, <hi>The Houſe of God, is the thought of a wiſeman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here now ariſes the diſpute, what is fitteſt for man to buſie his thoughts in, ſetting a part his Creatour. In this quarrel King <hi>David</hi> enters the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and avers, <hi>I thought upon old dayes, and the eternal years I had in mind.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 76.6.</note> This thought is moſt profitable; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes man, and is not unworthy of God.

One may ſeek an end in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he ſhall never find: Eternity knows no end, its not acquainted with any bounds, and for limits it admits of none: Eternity beſt deſerves to be thought on.</p>
               <p>Ten years ago I expoſed a draught of Eternity to the pulick view: it remains now for us to ſet before your eyes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to the eternity of the Damned: this requires our more ſerious reflexion; it being not ſufficient for us to ſcrape ſomewhat from the outſides of it, which may ſerve us to hear, write, or talk of;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29880:5"/>we muſt proceed further, and lodge E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the very boſome of our ſouls. wherefore the task of this Chapter ſhall be, to declare what we mean, when we write on the eternity of the Damned.</p>

                  <p>THe wiſeman of <hi>Rome</hi> friendly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates with <hi>Lucilius</hi> in this ſort:
<note place="margin">Sen. ep. 102:</note> 
                     <q>As he is troubleſome, who awakes a man from a pleaſant Dream, becauſe he bereaves him of that counterfeit, which yet reſembles real pleaſure: So thy Epiſtle did me wrong, for it took me off once and oftner from conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that ſuted with me. I was well pleaſed to enquire after, yea and beleive too the eternity of Souls: For well might I beleive the Opinions of great men. Beſides I had ſo much hope, that I now began to be irkſome to my ſelf, now I deſpiſed the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my feeble age, as being about to enter into that immenſe time, and the poſſeſſion of all ages: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thy Epiſtle awakned me, and ſo I loſt my goodly Dream; which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding i'le to again, when I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29880:6"/>done with thee, and hereby redeem what formerly I loſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am almoſt now of that Opinion, which <hi>Flavius Lucius Dexter</hi> of <hi>Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nona,</hi> an ancient Hiſtorian, one who had Command in the Eaſtern Empire, and an intimate friend to St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in a Chronicle of his at the year of Chriſt our Saviour ſixty four in theſe expreſs words: <q>
                        <hi>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</hi> native of <hi>Cordova</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Letters betwixt him and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had a good Opinion of Chriſtian Religion, became a Chriſtian private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is beleived to have been his Diſciple; to whom he writ with much feeling during his abode in Spain.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my part I affirm nothing in this particular, but reverence the teſtimony of the Ancient Chronicler: Yet certain it is, <hi>Annaeus Seneca</hi> did not only begin to think of, but likewiſe to beleive an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. We may obſerve this mans deep-ſearching Wit; he attempted, and went on moſt attentively to weigh Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in its proper Ballance: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation whereof he compares to a Dream, which lulls aſleep the toylſome watches of the outward ſenſes, and commands the inward to keep ſtrict
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29880:6"/>Centinel. This, this is to meditate, and to be withdrawn from this, <hi>Annaeus</hi> was much unwilling; in regard this kind of meditation proved ſo beneficial to him, as himſelf declares ſaying: <q>I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſmall reſidue of my life, and ſtretched my ſelf forward into that Volume of Ages never to be unfoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seneca</hi> by this time had a loathing of all things, if compared to the ſole poſſeſſion of that never ending Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of times. When Heathens meditate in this manner upon Eternity, what does it behove us Chriſtians to do? Our beleif of Eternity is bootleſs, if we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or tepedly think on it. Many are the reaſons which may move us dayly to meditate upon eternity: take this one in lieu of many: Eternity mollifies our hearts when they are as hard as flint and Steel; it quite vanquiſheth all the ſtubbornneſs of our Soul. That man is loſt whom Eternity doth not draw to a better life; he may take his courſe, he may periſh, who is in ſuch a dead-ſleep, as this dreadful thunder cannot awake him.</p>
                  <p>Here one may object: The Flames of Hell-fire may well be caſt in their way,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29880:7"/>who run amain towards Hell: why do you with them terrifie thoſe, that are dayly longing after Heaven; that abſtain from ſin not ſo much for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as for love of God? What need theſe ſo frequently to contemplate thoſe flames eternal? They need very much. Wherefore I ſhall lay down three documents, whereunto we are concerned often to look back in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 2.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt Document is: All Holy men are partakers of no ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by this contemplation of Hell: for whileſt they aſſuredly truſt themſelves to be out of the reach of thoſe ſcorching heats, their hearts even leap for joy; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with moſt amorous thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, moſt profound contempt of themſelves, and a moſt ample extolling of the Divine bounty. But for as much, as men of an upright conſcience do ſlip and have their faylings, therefore Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ever and anon plucks them, as it were by the ſleeve, and ſayes:—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, look to thy ſelf, thou art not yet ſhot free: thou knowſt not whether in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29880:7"/>Gods favour thou ſhalt give up thy Ghoſt: Final perſeverance is a meer gift of God, a meer Grace, which we are not able by any actions of our own to merit: in this point it is not lawful to call God our debtour, he ſtands diſingaged to every one. If then God deny to beſtow this grace upon thee, thou art utterly undone for ever.</p>
                  <p>This ſerves as a ſtrong bridle to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man; ſince we are not ignorant, that divers have ſerved God, ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſome fifty years, ſome longer; and yet have ſuſtained the loſs of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Holineſs by a ſinful end; witneſs that unfortunate <hi>Hero,</hi> of whom <hi>Caſſian</hi> makes mention. This, if ſeriouſly weighed, may ſtir up in each ones ſoul many pious affections.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Document is: Whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an attentive meditation of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preceds, there muſt needs follow a great care, a fervour of ſpirit, and a wonderful exactneſs in doing all our works. This cogitation alone teaches manifeſtly, that we owe all to God, as to our Soveraign Lord; and that we can never ſerve him ſo worthily, as we ought; but muſt needs acknowledge, that what ever we do is not anſwerable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29880:8"/>to, but far below ſo great a Majeſty. This ſame conſideration of Eternity puts us in mind of the preſent condition of our life; and withal warns us, that now it is time to take pains in erning repoſe without end; that years eternal will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, in which we may neither labour, nor merit any thing at all.</p>
                  <p>I remember to have read, and that with admiration, of a certain man, who framed this conceit of Eternity: What living man (ſaid he to himſelf) endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reaſon, and in his wits, would lay claim to the Kingdome of <hi>France, Spain, Poland,</hi> ſuch wealthy Dominions as theſe, upon condition, that before he came to be abſolute Lord of them, he ſhould lye with his face upward upon a delicate bed of Roſes for forty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? It may ſo fall out, that ſome one may be found overjoyed with the bargain, and ſo may begin to throw himſelf upon that ſoft and well-ſented lodging: yet queſtionleſs he will not continue his poſture for the ſpace of three whole years, but will forthwith depart from the former agreement, and ſay, Let me riſe, I would be deprived of three, yea all Kingdoms rather, then be conſtrayned to lye continually, as I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29880:8"/>conſented to do, upon never ſo ſoft a bed.</p>
                  <p>And does the matter ſtand even thus? Will no one of Reaſon, if he might enjoy three Kingdoms, take up his quarters, as aforeſaid, during the ſpace of thirty or forty years? what ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging madneſs then, and blind folly is it, for trifles, for toyes, for bables to will and do that, for which thou maiſt be tormented upon a hot-glowing-Grid-iron not for forty, nor four hundred, nor four thouſand, nor yet four hundred thouſand years, but for all Eternity? If therefore we provide not for our ſelves and affairs while we have time and ſpace, we are worſe then mad, and ſomething more then Furies hath ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on us.</p>

                  <p>THe third Document: I wiſh I could but obtain this one favour of all who read theſe things, that they would accuſtome themſelves to make uſe of two ſorts of Spectacles; the one Purple-coloured, the other blew; this later is to be uſed in this manner: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever matters go well with us, when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29880:9"/>the Body, Soul, or both, are well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; as often as comely and beautiful Objects are repreſented to the ſight, or harmonious concent tickles the Eares. or delightful attractives charm the taſt, or Sabaean Odours ſatiare the Noſtrils, or things of ſmootheſt temper flatter our touching, or in brief, when ever any thing contributes to our delight, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſatisfaction; then, then is the time to lay hold of our Sky-coloured Spectacle, and reaſon thus with our ſelves: Behold, this pleaſes, that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, the other gives content; but what is all this compared to the Eternity of the Bleſſed? what is this drop of Honey to that Sea of Delights in Heaven? Wherefore do I debar my ſelf from that Ocean of Pleaſures above, by gathering ſcattered drops here below? O caſt an eye up then towards that bleſſed Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; aſpire thither, where there is all plenty of pleaſure, that either is or may be imagined.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt Banquets and ſporting, yea amidſt great variety of Dainties, this Diſcourſe may be ſerviceable unto us. This Secret of Art may be made uſe of, when we are ſoothed by any kind of Complacence whatever. Lo, this is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29880:9"/>right uſe of the Azure Spectacle; to raiſe the mind from things preſent and terrene, to thoſe to be met with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Heaven: by this means we may be moderate amongſt allurements to exceſs, and environed with Pleaſures may paſs without peril.</p>
                  <p>But now on the contrary, when we are not well at eaſe, when pain Arreſts the Body, when ſadneſs ſeizes on the Soul; upon occaſion of what Corraſive or Affliction ſoever, take into your hand your Purple Glaſs, and ſpeak to your ſelf as followeth: Does this vexe thee, ſo much, does that Torture thee ſo far, as almoſt to make thee Frantick? Yet what a Flea-biting is this, if thou regard the Eternity of the Damned? Look down and take a view of Hell: what ever here moleſteth by Sufferings, Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Diſaſters, is and may be reputed one of the choiceſt Felicities on Earth, if we but lend an eye to thoſe never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Torments beneath.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore then doſt thou burden Heaven and Earth with idle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? This both diſcovers thy Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Folly: Tis clear, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what Hell is, otherwiſe theſe Complaints would ceaſe. After all this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29880:10"/>thou telleſt me thy Miſeries are many, thy Callamities intollerable. What? For want of houſe-room, art thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to lye in a Stall? But the Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are confined to Swine-ſties, which are repleniſhed with Fire and unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtench for ever. What? Hunger and thirſt frequently pinch thee? Know, that there is neither crumm of Bread, or drop of water to aſſwage either; they hunger, they thirſt, and that for ever. What? Thou ſwimmeſt in thine own tears, through ſharpneſs of Affliction? Even this, if thou wilt, may be turned into conſolation. There is Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth for ever. What? Thy Enemies weary thee out, envious and ſlanderous people make havack of thy good name? Yet what is this to Hell? where the moſt hateful company of the Divels and Damned muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for ever? What? ſadneſs and cares pine thee away? But there deſpair everlaſtingly will rent thy heart a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To make ſhort; if here the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of lodging hinder thy repoſe: there an abyſſe of Flames will encompaſs thee on every ſide, without hope of one ſole minute of reſt for Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Who ſo employes theſe Spectacles,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29880:10"/>will not grumble though evils in their height ruſh in upon him: things bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome and ungrateful may befall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but what ever happens to him is welcome and eaſily ſupported, while he cryes out—O my God, All theſe Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which have an end, are tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, are pleaſing, yea and a Paradiſe too, when I remember the endleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the Reprobate.</p>

               <p>IN theſe Countreys, which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite, the nights are longeſt in Winter, and ſhorteſt in Summer. Yet it may ſo happen, that to ſome one a Summers night may ſeem longer, then one in Winter. How long muſt that night needs be, which in a few hours made that Head hoaty, which was black before? This truth is made out as well by witneſs of credit, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Didacus Oſorius</hi> by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being impriſoned at <hi>Sevil,</hi> through grief in one nights ſpace became white like Snow: at ſuch an Exchange, Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al admiting ſings—

Such nights are in Hell, where the wretches are ever a dying, and never dead indeed. Alas! the night is long, which exceeds a year, and extends it ſelf beyond the limits of an age. That night is exceſſive long, after which never day appears; that night is full of Horror, which is enveloped in eternal darkneſs: with ſuch night, with ſuch obſcurity as this, does God revenge himſelf of his enemies; whoſe dwelling is remote from Sun, Moon and Stars:

                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of this puniſhment ſaying: <q>We ſhall all mourn moſt ſadly, when the Fire with vehemence oppreſſeth us: We ſhall ſee none, beſides thoſe who are fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in damnation, and a vaſt ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Who can expreſs what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frights will ariſe from this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? As that fire has no power to conſume, ſo it cannot ſhine; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be no darkneſs: which brings upon thoſe Inhabitants Fear, Trembling, Solitude, and a numneſs with amazement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for inward darkneſs, which School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men term <hi>Pain of loſs,</hi> or a privation of the ſight of God; this is ſo great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that none greater can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: For as to ſee God is bliſs it ſelf, and the top of Felicity, ſo to be deprived
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29880:14"/>of the viſion of God for ever, is the chiefeſt pain of the Damned; whence ariſeth in their wills a marvellous kind of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>The Faulcon, while his eyes are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the hood, flies neither after Duck nor Mallard, Heron, nor other Prey: but ſo ſoon as the hood is pluckt off and he eſpies his game, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit whereof he is carried by Nature, tis not facil to keep him quiet on the Fiſt, he baits, he ſtrives to break the Lures, and is in danger either to hurt himſelf, or weary his Faulconer; ſo violently is he carried after the Fowl he once ſets Eye on.</p>
                  <p>Not unlike to this is mans condition: While we live in this world, we ſeem to be hoodwinkt, we walk in darkneſs. Hence tis no marvail, that we are not raviſht with deſire to ſee God: there is a veil betwixt him and us, which takes off our eagerneſs: but immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death has rent the Veil, and the ſouls at liberty from bodily contagion, it being now plac'd in the vaſt extent of Eternity, and put into poſſeſſion of its freedome, will forthwith be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſuch violence towards its Creator, that of all Torments, this

                  <p>Every loſs is ſo much the greater, by how much the greater good it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of. Tis a great Fine to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to pay ten thouſand Crowns, twenty or thirty is greater, but above all is an hundred thouſand: Yet this is far exceeded by another damage, which robs one of many Millions of Gold, yea of all Treaſures too, during life.

A tree were more gently dealt with, if it were ſinged with fire, then if it were ſo grubbed up by the roots, that hereafter you may deſpair to have it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flouriſh or bring forth fruit. The like is mans caſe in this particular, whoſe pain would be milder to undergo thoſe ſcorching heats, then to be for ever ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht from the Face of God.</p>
                  <p>A ſemblance, or ſhadow of what I ſay, may be met with even in this life: Such as have grievouſly ſinned againſt God, are ſometimes ſcourged with a twofold whip: The firſt of pain; ſo <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> yet alive, burſt out into ſwarms of Vermin, as if they had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29880:16"/>been dead Carcaſſes, or rotten Cheeſe, certainly they were ſmitten by God. The ſecond is the ſcourge of Anguiſh or ſadneſs, whereby all ſolace is taken from the offender, who by this time finds no comfort in God. This is an ante-paſt, or foretaſt of Hell: whereof notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding eminent Saints have had their ſhare: Therefore Holy <hi>David</hi> cries out <hi>Cast me not away from thy face: turn not away thy face from me.</hi> Now as it fares both with Saints and Sinners, who even in this life taſt of the pain of <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Loſs,</hi> that they may be informed what paſſes in Hell: So thoſe whoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hurls them down thither, groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heavy burden of both kinds of puniſhment, and ſhall ſee no light for ever.</p>

                  <p>A certain perſon might have been poſſeſt of an Inheritance worth ten thouſand Crowns, but through a ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful careleſneſs lets the time ſlip, and ſo falls ſhort of it.

This ſame happens to each one of the Damned; I might, ſaies he, grace was not wanting, I was called upon: I might, Alas! I might, it was in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but I would not.

                  <p>A grief it is not to be expreſt, for one to call to mind, how through his own fault he is deprived of ſo great a good.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29880:17"/>upon the loſs of it. An Infant, when the Patents die, knows not what it loſes by their death: therefore it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſighs nor weeps. Thus we do, when we ſin: we little know, poor wretches! what Treaſures we caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p>None in this life is overwhelmed with ſuch extream Miſeries, but he may find ſome ſlender ſpace to breath in. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we have no exact knowledge how affairs ſtand in the World to come. Hence you may perchance find ſome one who, with <hi>Gilimer</hi> King of the <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> will laugh under a great burden of evils. But know, all Laughter is baniſht from hell.</p>
                  <p>In every mortal crime, <hi>Averſion</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> are chiefly conſiderable. To ſpeak with Divines, he that ſins, averts himſelf from the Creatour, and converts himſelf to the Creature: which is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold injury to God: To averſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore correſponds the pain of loſs, as to converſion that of ſence; this yeilds to the other ſo much, that he, who felt the firſt alone, would be far from laughing, would have Hell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in that one pain of loſs.

If a man had uſed his utmoſt endeavours, and left no wind unſailed, that he might compaſs Honours, Riches, or a beloved Eſpouſe, and in this perſuite had ſpared neither Labour nor Charges, till all things were
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29880:19"/>in a readineſs to Solemnize the Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, and then another ſhould unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſtep between him and home: were not this enough to force the poor man off his Senſes? Here Shame and Loſs meet to his Deſtruction, which muſt be endured; or he muſt ſhake hands with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or claſh with his oppoſer.</p>
                  <p>Couple me now this man thus fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of his hope, with another buried in everlaſting darkneſs; and you will find a palpable difference: that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his quarters, chaſe other Honors, and win a new Eſpouſe; but this can neither change place, nor eſcape his torments, he is wholly void of hope and moſt deſperate for ever. Nevertheleſs he is forced to acknowledge that God was careful of him, God called him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times into his way again; but he ſlighted the Call, and refuſed to follow his guide. He knows right well where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Created, wherefore by Chriſt redeem'd, wherefore Baptized, whitherto invited: hither forſooth that he would vouchſafe to come, and mount the Throne of Glory in that bleſſed Kingdome, where he might live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the embracements of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. But I, ſaies he to himſelf, am in

                     </gap>inately are we ſometimes bent to ſadneſs. It is Authentically Recorded of an Emperour of the laſt Age, that he was ſo oppreſt with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as no Muſical Harmony, no Playes or Paſtimes, no mirth or pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation whatever, was able to reduce him to cheerfulneſs. Good Lord! what means all this? what inſtruction may we gather hence? This ſurely: O Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals! Do you not perceive that all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires are a meer painted vanity? See you not now that your ſelves and all you have, wholly depends on God? Learn this after all, that all your Joyes amaſſed in one, are not powerful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, to raiſe up to mirth a Soul drenched in Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>The matter ſtands thus indeed: thou haſt, O God! guilty perſons enough who confeſs this truth. Nevertheleſs,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29880:20"/>if but for one ſole moment, God did ſhew His Divine Countenance to a man overwhelmed with nere ſo much greif, all Clouds of ſorrow would in a trice be quite diſperſed: farr better, then his would be who ſuddenly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keing out of a diſmal Dream, ſhould find himſelf in ſome ſtately Palace ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a joyful company of his Boſome-friends.</p>
                  <p>Moreover to ſee God is an Ocean of ſuch immenſe delight, that, though a man were in Flames of fire, yet whilſt he ſaw God, through exceſs of joy he would not be ſenſible of burning.

                  <p>THis darkneſs or privation of the ſight of God, is the firſt and cheifeſt puniſhment of the Damned eternally: herewith the blindneſs of mans heart is juſtly chaſtiſed, it being the firſt and laſt of evils in this life. He is altogether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable

                  <p>Of this ſtamp were thoſe two wicked old men, treacherous Judges of the chaſt <hi>Suſanna,</hi>

                  <p>Hence let no man wonder, if many, polluted with foul offences, proceed without ſcruple; ſince blindneſs hath prepoſſeſt their ſouls. Their former faults bereaved them of day, ſo now they go on ſecure under the ſhadow of a wicked night: they ſubvert their ſenſe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29880:21"/>decline their eyes that they may not ſee Heaven. <hi>Iob</hi> made a Covenant with his eyes, that they ſhould not behold a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; they with theirs, not to look up to Heaven; fearing perchance leaſt it ſhould ſtrike them with terrour, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
                  <p>This is the property of a Soule plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in darkneſs and ſin, which therefore the pain of loſs does moſt juſtly torture: you would not ſee God, you ſhall not ſee him for ever.

He leaves Grapes to rot upon the Vine, who with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> refuſeth to weep. In the other world tears come too late, let us Weep amain in this. Wo to thoſe miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who go into that Houſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wailing: there they muſt begin to weep, but ſhall never meet with the end of it: Eternity fills their eyes with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual tears.</p>
               <p>This is their ſecond Torment in Hell Weeping; whereof our Saviour ſpeaks expreſly:
<note place="margin">Matt. 13 Luk. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Darkneſs of which we treated in the precedent Chapter, ſerves to torment the eyes; and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſubject of the enſuing, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rack to the ears.</p>

                  <p>CHriſt in his moſt Divine Sermons, made frequent mention of the tears of the Damned, leaſt the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that exceſſive pain ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Hence are thoſe words ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated: <hi>There ſhall be weeping
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29880:25"/>and gnaſhing of Teeth. Weeping,</hi> (ſaies St. Bernard) <hi>by reaſon of that unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fire; Gnaſhing,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">S. Bern. ſuper qui habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat.</note> 
                     <hi>for that their worm ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyeth. Their weeping proceeds from their pain, their gnaſhing of Teeth from the fury they are ſeiſed with. The cruelty of their Torments enforceth them to weep, the vehemency of repining, envy, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate malice, cauſes in them gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Hitherto this holy Father.</p>
                  <p>Concerning timely weeping, truth it ſelf hath ſpoken:
<note place="margin">Matt. 4</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Here we ſometimes take a pleaſure in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; there eternal rears are void of all comfort. That of the Poet is well known:
<q>
                        <l>Weeping doth our pain aſſwage,</l>
                        <l>Tears from grief, us diſ-engage.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in Hell all ſorts of torments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive increaſe from weeping, as doth the fire from Oyl or Brimſtone caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the damned let fall one onely tear every day, and God (as he might eaſily do) ſhould keep theſe dayly tears together, they would at length amount to an Ocean of tears ſo vaſt, that it alone would far exceed all the Seas of this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29880:26"/>world. Nevertheleſs though the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned howl and wail moſt bitterly, yet they ſhed not one ſole tear: even as graceleſs children, who when chaſtiſed by their Parents, part not with one ſalt drop from their eyes, becauſe they are grown ſtiff-hearted againſt ſtripes: In like manner the damned, whoſe will is moſt obſtinate, albeit they rage. they roar, and fill the air with horrid out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries, notwithſtanding no moyſture of piety iſſues from their eyes. All of them fill their Denns with confuſed howlings, as beaſts do, which are preſently to be lead away to the ſlaughter. Out, alas! what Muſick is this, which will never ceaſe for all eternity?</p>
                  <p>What St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified of the joyes of Heaven: <hi>Neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, &amp;c.</hi> The very ſame may be affirmed of the furious howling of the Damned: Such lamentable complaints, ſuch outragious wailings, ſuch terrible roarings are thoſe of the damned, that no one hath ever heard the like.</p>
                  <p>Let us call to mind, I beſeech you, thoſe cruel Gardens of <hi>Nero,</hi> wherein he uſed to ſupp, while Chriſtians on every ſide being faſtned to ſtakes, were burned with a ſlow fire to ſerve as Torches in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29880:26"/>the night. How ſad and lamentable were the howlings of theſe Chriſtians? Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine only a thouſand tyed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amidſt the flames, and as many more with their thighs broken upon a Rack yet alive, with pittiful moans bewailing the greatneſs of their torments.

                  <p>GOD hath moſt wiſely ordained, that what ſhall mervailouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light all the bleſſed, the contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall incredibly torment the damned. Frequent mention is made in holy writ, of Celeſtial Harmony and Muſick of the Bleſſed, all whoſe exteriour ſenſes ſhall enjoy their ſeveral delights: So contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe in Hell it will be a ſpecial tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29880:27"/>to hear inceſſantly the horrible complaints, howling and mourning of ſo many hundred Millions; as if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oxen were roaſted alive, or ſo many mad dogs ſtrugled to break their chains, but could not.</p>
                  <p>How ungrateful Muſick would it be, if your neighbour had a Kennel of Dogs, who with continual barking ſhould keep a reſtleſs ſick man all night awake? But O how melodious would this cry of dogs be! O how gentle, how ſhort-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting would this Hell appear; if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe fiery caverns repleniſhed with eternal howling!</p>
                  <p>Yet this is a juſt puniſhment for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt amorous ſongs, for laſcivious ſtrains: in place whereof, wo, wo, wo everlaſting will fill their ears. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned will curſe God and his Saints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing, yea and themſelves too, together with all who have been their companions in ſin: The Father will curſe his Son, the Son the Father; the Mother her Daughter, and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Mother; they will curſe all the years, dayes and houres of their lives for ever.</p>
                  <p>But they will weep with dry cheeks for nothing ſo much, as for that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29880:27"/>loſs of time: to have laviſht ſo many good houres, ſo many dayes, weeks, moneths and years, and that with ſo much idleneſs, will be unto them cauſe of moſt peircing grief, but alas! too late.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Reginaldus</hi> recounts, how a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man being at his prayers heard a doleful voice: he demanded who was there, why he mourned, what would he have? Whereunto the voice made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; I am one of the damned. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (replyed the other) doſt thou mourn ſo ſadly? to whom the voice ſaid, I and the reſt of the damned bewail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo bitterly, as to have conſumed the ſpace of our lives in wickedneſs. Out alas! one houres time had been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to gain that, which from henceforth for all eternity will not be granted.</p>
                  <p>This ſaying was too true, but too late: hereupon grew that pious cuſtome amongſt the vertuous, every hour to raiſe up the mind towards Heaven, with theſe or the like words: <hi>O my Lord, O my God!

                  <p>NOw therefore our ſighs avail us; now, if we will, our tears are as ſo many Pearls: now we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to weep, that we may not ſigh and weep forever.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Antipater</hi> had written to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> many things relating to his Mother, and the King had read them; he ſaid: <hi>Antipater</hi> does not know, that one ſmall tear let fall by a mother, is able to aboliſh whole Epiſtles ſtuffed with ſlaunders. I may in ſome ſort averr the ſame of thoſe guilty Inhabitants of Hell: the Damned were not pleaſed to take notice, that with one ſalt drop from the eye, if ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if timely, all offences what ever might be quite waſhed away.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon St.
<note place="margin">Ser. 16. in Cant.</note> 
                     <hi>Bernard</hi> exclaims: <hi>Who will give water to my head &amp; a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of tears to my eyes, that with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I may prevent weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth and ſtrait bands of hands and Feet, and a great weight of Chains preſſing, binding, burning, and not conſuming?
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29880:28"/>There ſhall be weeping:</hi> By St. <hi>Matthew</hi> alone, this is four times repeated:
<note place="margin">Matt. 8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>The children of the Kingdome ſhall be caſt out into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> The ſame is itte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: <hi>And ſhall caſt them into the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of fire; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. In the very height of jollity and mirth at the Wedding, againſt one ill cloathed this ſentence paſſed: Caſt him into utter darkneſs, there ſhall be wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Weeping wants no ſolace, while the dead, we mourn for, is yet within our doors; but ſo ſoon as he is carried out not to return, ſo ſoon as he is caſt into a hole, not to come out till the day of Judgement, here whole ſhowres are powred out, here we give him a moſt ſorrowful and laſt farwel: Thus all mourning in this world has its comfort. Yea, even as thoſe, who dream they weep when the dream is over, find their cheeks dry, and wonder they were ſo ſadly deluded; in like manner when the deceitful dreams of this life are paſt, and we awake to eternity, we ſhall both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and condemn our tears without fruit. Indeed our wailing here is like that of Dreamers; there, <hi>there ſhall be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29880:29"/>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> and that through exceſſive pains.</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed I pray, now and then to make ſome ſmall tryal hereof: apply your finger to a ſlender wax-light ſet on fire but for half a quarter of an hour: O what howlings, what ſhowtings out will follow hence! you would think the whole man were thrown into the fire, when alas! only the fingers end is ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. What, I beſeech you, are theſe imaginary, theſe painted Flames to Hell? <hi>There ſhall be weeping, there ſhall be gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Weeping ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from fire, gnaſhing of teeth from unexplicable cold. Where mark by the way, the damned ſhall ever have their ſenſes moſt lively, that they may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</p>
                  <p>This may be obſerved, in thoſe who are ſick of a Feavour, in whom becauſe the ſenſe of pain is quick, therefore they whet their teeth to cut the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their Malady in pieces. In this ſort the damned enjoy the quickneſs of ſenſes moſt entirely, that they may be ſenſible of their torments; therefore, as if they could mitegate their ſufferings, they are ſaid to weep and whet one tooth againſt another.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:29880:29"/>
                  <p>With good reaſon they ſhall weep, they ſhall howl, becauſe while they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Chriſt Crucified before them wept, and powred out of all his moſt delicate Members plenty of blood, but in vain: their good Angel often wearied their ears with wholeſome admonitions, but in vain: all the bleſſed moved them to amendment of life, but in vain: God himſelf thirty, ſorty, fifty, threeſcore years and more called upon and invited them to take a better courſe, but all in vain.

                  <p>If thoſe in the Valley either hear not, or ſleight ſo truſty a Moniter, they runn upon their own ruine. Does the Ice deceive them? Does the water ſwallow them up?

Imagine the worſt you can to torment the Ears: The ſhouting of men, the Barking of Doggs, the Howling of Wolves, the lowing of Oxen, the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Lions, with the ungrateful noiſe made by other Beaſts; the Claps of Thunder in the Clouds, the ſteep fall of Waters, and whatever may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved offenſive to the Ears; Alas! all that is nothing to the moſt deſperate weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth they endure in Hell.</p>
                  <p>Reſort hither all you, whoſe breaſts boyl with hatred and envy; all you who

                  <p>Enter into conſideration of our life, and you ſhall find, that we eagerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to each others ruine. What profit then I pray do we purſue? This one; ſo ſoon as our adverſary lies open to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we ſheath the Sword of Revenge up to the Hilts in his overthrow: This is the work of malice, this unſatiable envy perſues amain. Even as dogs when they quarrel, ſhew their teeth; ſo we dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like men, or inhumane dogs deal one with another, and now and then fall at odds for a bare bone.</p>
                  <p>O you, who ſwell with hatred and pine away with envy, why do you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the nature of dogs, why do you imitate the Damned?

               </head>
               <p>THat exquiſite Maſter of Rhetorick <hi>Quintilian</hi> had the boldneſs to ſay:
<note place="margin">Quinti. decl. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The Plague is happy Warr is happy, and all kind of Death is eaſy: But Hunger is hard, the moſt pinching of neceſſities, the moſt deformed of evils.</hi> An evil unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that needs muſt be, to which the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29880:34"/>greateſt of evils compared are to be held in eſteem: ſuch an evil as this, in <hi>Quintillians</hi> opinion, is hunger; amongſt all miſeries worthily accounted the chiefeſt. This aſſertion is not without reaſon: ſince both by ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Hiſtory it is apparent, that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of hunger ſometimes brings men to that height of madneſs, as to tear their own fleſh in pieces with their teeth,
<note place="margin">Baron ad an. 491.</note> and to nouriſh their bodies by imparing them. <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour did thus, who was buried before he was dead.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo indeed? is nine dayes hunger ſo cruel a kind of death, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver death compared unto it, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a gentle puniſhment? What then will a Famine of ten years, of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, a thouſand, a million of ages be, from which all hope of releif is quite cut off? I may truly ſay of this: hunger is the ſharpeſt of neceſſities, hunger is the worſt of miſeries.</p>
               <p>This rageing evil is the third torment of that doleful eternity. The Prophet long ago threatned this kind of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>They ſhall ſuffer Famine as dogs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 58.</note> He is truly miſerable, who having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to eat, finds nothing to aſſwage his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29880:35"/>hunger: much more is he, who alwaies gapes after meat with a greedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, but meets with nothing, nor ever ſhall, to ſatisfie his ſtomack. Nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, he is not only afflicted with extream hunger, but is parched with moſt vehement thirſt beſide. Such is the hunger, ſuch the thirſt of the damned; whereof in the enſuing Chapter.</p>

<note place="margin">Luk. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo to you that are filled: becauſe you ſhall be hungry.</hi> Such hunger ſhall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs you, as will exceed that of a day, a moneth, a year; and ſuch an one, to whom not a few, but all things ſhall be wanting. No one will, no one can give either crumm, or drop. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of dainties paſt will ſharpen and ſet their ſtomacks on fire, that the pain of Gluttony may accompany the fault and the puniſhment be anſwerable to the offence:
<note place="margin">Wiſ. 11.</note>

                  <p>One may offend many wayes by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29880:35"/>Gluttony: Firſt, when too much meat and drink is taken, even againſt our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which frequently grumbles not for want, but exceſſe. The ſtomach has its mouth, which wants not words: the ſtomach is filled with indignation, and Belching ſaies: O I am oppreſt, I am ſurcharged, I faint, I periſh: Too much kindneſs kills me: Fain I would be refreſht, not ſtifled: I would be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, not choaked: I am not to be ſtuffed with meat, as a Boulſter with Feathers: This ſort of good will hurts me worſe then hatred or emptineſs. Theſe are the complaints of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach: Of which St.
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. in c. 2. <hi>Joan.</hi>

                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that, <hi>What exceeds neceſſity in eating, doth harm; but nouriſhes not: Fulneſs is the root of all Diſeaſes.</hi> So the firſt fault in Gluttony is, to feed too plentifully.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond fault is, to have a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch delicate and coſtly viands, that of neceſſity the Sea muſt be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into, and ſhell fiſhes fetched from the unknown ſhores of the remoteſt Seas. Beſides the Feaſant, other ſorts of fowl muſt be had, to ſatisfie ambition in the Kitchin. What a dainty ſtomach
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29880:36"/>will ſcarcely admit of muſt be brought in from the fartheſt Ocean: To pleaſe the Palate, which loaths ordinary fare, ſearch is made farr and near: the whole world muſt be ranſacked for belly cheer, which is then daintieſt when deareſt: So <hi>Alagabalus</hi> Emperour, inhabiting the Sea coſt, would never feed upon fiſh. Theſe kind of people are poſſeſt with a hunger of greater extent, then their belly: they vomit that they may drink, and drink that they may vomit: Bankets ſought for throughout the World, they greedily devour, which by and by they reject the ſame way they were received.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve here by the way: That is accounted a Soverain diſh though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe moſt vile, which the appetite moſt longs for. Hence it may come to paſs, that one may offend more grieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with feaſting on toad-ſtools, then another on Partridge and Feaſants. <hi>Eſau</hi> was reprehended for over greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gurmandiling a diſh of Pulſe-Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not for eating fat Hens or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</p>
                  <p>The third fault is, to laviſh too much time and treaſure in feaſting; many
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29880:36"/>feaſt in a Circle as the children of <hi>Iob</hi> did; they leave ſcarce one day in a year free from Riot and Exceſſe in Banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>Parents now and then Propheſie to their children: Wo be to thee my boy, when thou comeſt into ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where thou ſhalt want thoſe dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thou didſt enjoy at home: How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth will it be for thee either to take pains or ſtarve? The like may be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Parents: Wo be to you, who feed plentifully every day, how will you be able to digeſt Hunger and Thirſt?</p>
                  <p>The fourth fault of Gluttony is, raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to violate the Laws of Faſt, or at leaſt to expound them as they liſt. Hence the faſt of forty dayes in Lent is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ten or twenty dayes temperance. Many beleive they are faſting, when they are not drunk. We are now come to that paſs, as to perſwade our ſelves, that faſting was only ordained for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious People: others are ſo favourable Interpreters of this Law, as they ſtill find ſome excuſe to free them from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. But the Phyſitian, you ſay, and my Confeſſour exempt me from faſting:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29880:37"/>true, but over entreated by your impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: I beleive they would be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, if they met with one leſs eloquent, and more indigent.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, Drunkenneſs, the Origin of many crimes, and of all Vices the moſt dangerous, becauſe if a drunken man chance to fall ſuddainly, which is not unuſual, or be ſurpriſed with ſome diſeaſe, which hales him to the Gates of Death; where poor wretch! unable to grieve for his ſins, or to raiſe his mind up to his Maker, in the ſtate of mortal ſin and ignorant of his ſad condition, he is hurried away to Eternity, alas! a prey to Death and to the Devil.</p>

                  <p>Conſider what a great ſhare of our miſery it is, that we neither value, nor ſufficiently underſtand the affaires of the next life. Which of us has made tryal of extream Famine? Hence we weigh not our own, nor the Famine in Hell. A pattern of this manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Cities Beſieged, and in cloſe Priſons: For to that extreamity are people brought by rageing hunger, that not only Dogs, Cats and Horſes, but alſo Mice, Serpents and Toads are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily devoured by them: they pluck the Graſs up by the roots, they ſtrip their Bucklers off their skins to feed on: Hunger compels them to convert into
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29880:38"/>mans meat the Excrements of Birds and Beaſts; yea and the bodies too of their deareſt friends.</p>

Tender ſprouts and tops of trees ſupplyed their wants in the begining, afterwards they boyled skins or what ever they met with to aſſwage their hunger; in fine, neither finding Herbs, Rats nor Cattel, they ſlaughtered every tenth man, a remedy againſt Famine worſe then Famine it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This was but a little, Hunger put them upon more cruel deſigns: The Mothers butchered their own Children, as if they had been Chickens, and with their own teeth tore in peices members dearer then their life. This may yet ſeem little when compared to more wild attempts: How often have people in Priſon maſſacred themſelves through hunger, and fed upon their own limbs?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29880:38"/>what way ſoever they could lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on arms or ſhoulders, thither their teeth haſtned to make a prey of themſelves to their own deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>NOw to the matter in hand: This hunger which we behold with our eyes, we are not ſufficiently capable of, and how then ſhall we underſtand that moſt rageing and eternal Famine in Hell? by how much our hunger is more Rampant, by ſo much it is the ſhorter; whereas that other, though moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is nevertheleſs everlaſting.

                  <p>Contrary wiſe that malignant tongue of the Damned ſhall flow in bitter Gall; this was foretold by the Hebrew Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
<note place="margin">Deut. 2. ch. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>The Gall of Dragons their Wine, and the Venim of Aſps uncurable.</hi> No ſweetneſs can be of force to mitigate this hunger, or temper the bitterneſs of this Gall; their torments are uncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Moreover ſome are of opinion, that they are afflicted with moſt cruel fits of the tooth-ach: who ever has experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe in this life, let him imagine how afflictive they will be after death. In caſe there were no other torments in Hell, beſides thoſe of the teeth or head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake, or Gout or Stone, and theſe being
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29880:39"/>to endure for ever, what expences, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and royl would one undergo to be quit of them? But we fear and fear not theſe things, while with exceeding cheerfulneſs we commit ſins more to be feared.</p>
                  <p>In Inns now and then wee feed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, we drink off full bowls, we ſing merrily we dance and skip about: but as ſoon as the Hoſt brings in the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and calls his gueſts to an account, they are at a ſtand, they look one upon another, and at length break forth into theſe words: would to God we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come hither! our ſhot is wonderful dear.</p>
                  <p>While we are here on our journey, we live in an Inn and unmindful of the reckoning, Feaſt jovially, carouſe till within night, ſing, ſport and dance. But who will diſcharge the ſhot? O people ill adviſed! We muſt pay a juſt recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, though a dear one. Tis we have Banketted, Quaffed, and playd the good fellows; tis we have waſted our health, age and ſubſtance in riotous company keeping: Now mine Hoſt calls for a diſcharge, juſt debts muſt be paid, Creditours will have ſatisfaction either

                  <p>We have eaten, but with exceſs, with too much expence and delecacy; we have Feaſted, but too often, and at too high a rate: We have faſted, but in a prophane manner and too ſeldome; we have buried our ſelves in Wine, we muſt now digeſt the ſurfetting. Wo, becauſe we ſhall be hungry: eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, thirſts eternal expects us: O what a Supper after a full, but ſhort dinner! while the damned lived they ſeem to have licked nothing but ſalt, ſo rageing is their thirſt in hell.</p>

Lo, how modeſtly be begs? He does not crave a Baſon of water, nor a Barrel of Oyle, nor a Veſſel of Wine: but what is moſt obvious, a drop of Water, which yet he obtains not. This wealthy Banketter is grown ſo poor, that he does not ask a Goblin of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal, but the extremity of a finger; not the choiceſt Wine from <hi>Greet,</hi> but a ſmall parcel of water; not to have ſome Noble Cub-bearer, but the Beggar <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi>

                  <p>TWo brothers as it is recorded, the one wiſe, the oter a Fool, went a Travellin together, and came at length

<note place="margin">Pet. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. In ſpec.</note> The Fool was taken with the more pleaſant way, the wiſe man preferred the more rugged, as more ſecure. Here they fell at debate, wherein the wiſe man deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it better to yeild then conteſt: So both were ſurpriſed by Robbers, both were caſt into Priſon, but the one a part from the other: whence after a time they were brought before a judge. Here the wiſe man accuſed the Fool, and laid all the fault on him: the fool retorts all the miſcarriage upon his brother. In concluſion the Judge makes this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: Both are guilty; the fool, becauſe he ſhould have ſubmitted to one wiſer then himſelf; the wiſe man, becauſe he ſhould not have condeſcended to a fool. This is plainly our condition: the Soul and Body are brothers, but extreamly unlike; the ſoul by its deſcent being Noble and Wiſe, is not afraid of a thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to Heaven, ſhe loves tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and enters into ſtrict league with Faſting, as knowing well how theſe things avail her: the ſpirit is prompt. On the other ſide the body from its birth is fooliſh, ſo eſpying a way that ſmiles with many delights, it preſently haſtens thither: it is forceably perſwaded that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29880:42"/>all it has to do, is to eat, drink, ſport, ſleep well fly from labour, follow idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and repoſe amongſt pleaſures; theſe things agree well with the body: but toyl hunger, watching, it hates and avoydes, as one would the Plague.</p>
                  <p>The Soul again endeavours with all her Rhetorick to evince, that a ſmooth way leads not to Heaven, as doth the ſharp and ſtony; and that they who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not away with thorns, covet not Roſes. But the body is ſlow in obeying, dull in admitting wholeſome counſel; it will not be friends with ſubjection and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallity: ſo at length the ſoul yeelds, and permitting the body to live as it liſts, becomes of a Maſter, a ſlave. In this maner they go and periſh together, thus they fall into the hands of theeves, vices and Devils.</p>
                  <p>Theſe brothers are parted in the end, and committed to ſeveral priſons; the body to the Grave, and the ſoul to hell: whence both are to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before the Soveraign Judge at the latter day, where each will accuſe the other. Now becauſe the fooliſh body would not be obedient to the ſoul, and the wiſe ſoul was not of courage to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the wantonneſs of the fleſh, both

O Chriſtians, a little more conſideration would do well: to eat and drink is not forbidden, provided it be not againſt conſcience, or with neglect of Divine Laws. We deſpiſe good counſel, and dare tranſgreſs the commands of God; not reflecting that the Gibbet is ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before our doors: Wo to you that are filled, becauſe you ſhall be hungry.

               </p>
               <p>Look down into Hell, and you will confeſs, there was never ſo noyſome and cruel a Goal, neither that under ground of the <hi>Meſſenians,</hi> called <hi>The Treaſure;</hi> nor that of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> called <hi>Lethe,</hi> or oblivion; nor the <hi>Quarries</hi> of <hi>Syracuſa;</hi> nor the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Creet;</hi> nor the <hi>Houſe</hi> and Dungeon of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> nor the <hi>Tullianum</hi> of the Romans; nor the <hi>Ceramon</hi> of the Cyprians; nor the <hi>Decas</hi> of the Spartans; nor the <hi>Ancon</hi> of <hi>Gilimer;</hi> nor that infamous Priſon of <hi>Actiolinus,</hi> which for cruelty ſurpaſſed all ſorts of torments: Neither were there ever detained in any Priſon ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in thraldom, as God puniſheth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Captives in his grand Priſon.</p>
               <p>This Priſon of God under ground, if you look upon the place, is moſt deep; if upon the Jaylor, he is moſt cruel; if on the foulneſs of it, it is moſt ſtinking; if on the impriſoned, it is of vaſt extent containing innumerable; yet if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the infinite number of offenders, it is exceeding ſtrait: In fine, if you ſeek after its continuance, it is eternal; none can eſcape thence, all paſſages and gates being cloſely locked up. And forasmuch
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29880:45"/>as all the filth of the whole world is devolved into this Dungeon, it is a moſt naſty ſink, a Den repleniſht with loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtink: This is the fourth torment of eternity, intollerable ſtench.

                  <p>THe holy Scripture frequently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to our conſideration the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtench of Hell.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.</note> Holy <hi>David</hi> ſaies: <hi>He ſhall rain ſnares upon ſinners: fire and brimſtone, and blaſt of ſtorms the potion of their Cup.</hi> Now as drops of rain may not be numbred, ſo the pains of the wicked: He ſhall rain torments upon them like a turbulent ſhowre, or ſwift running torrent. He ſhall rain ſnares; wherewith they ſhall be ſo faſt bound, as it will be impoſſible for any of them to eſcape, or to break their chains, or to undermine the Priſon walls, wherein they ſhall be incloſed. <hi>Their part ſhall be in the Pool burning with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. c. 21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here let us come nearer to our preſent matter; and conſider attentively, how
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29880:45"/>great will the ſtench be of one burning in brimſtone? How if a hundred, if a thouſand be joyned in the like flame? This yet is nothing to the brimſtone in Hell; whoſe ſtench ariſeth from divers cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, after the world is buried as it were in one grave, after the general judgement, all the Ordure of the Earth ſhall run down into that ſink of Hell, whereby the world ſhall be purged. The Pſalmiſt foretold:
<note place="margin">Pſa. 96.</note> 
                     <hi>Fire ſhall go before him, and ſhall inflame his enemies round about.</hi> Divines relying on this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy affirm, that fire ſhall go before the worlds judge as an apparitour, and ſhall bring all before the Tribunal, till the whole judgement be compleatly ended: that done, and the definitive ſentence pronounced, that fire like a thunderbolt ſhall throw down the wicked headlong, and as an Executioner ſhall ſet upon and bind that guilty multitude ſo faſt, as they ſhall deſpair of ever eſcape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Then will it hurry them like chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dogs into their kennels, he ſhall enflame his enemies round about: and together with them all the filth and mud of the world ſhall flow down into the Lake of hell; for hell is indeed the ſink
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29880:46"/>of the earth, the receptacle of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe of ſtench is Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra</note> whereof the eye of our Lord, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>Their part ſhall be in the pool burning with fire and brimſtone:</hi> which is the ſecond death. The ſacred volumes of Scripture are wonderful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in obſerving every word: In the <hi>pool,</hi> which contains ſtinking and immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble waters, which do not grow leſs, do not flow out, nor are dryed up: after a thouſand years this pool will be like it ſelf; after thirty, yea threeſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years it will loſe nothing it once had; after a hundred thouſand, after a thouſand Millions of years that pool will not have one drop of it dryed up: As it was in the beginning, ſo it will be then, and for all enſuing ages.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuch as had plunged their ſoul in wantonneſs and luſt in this life, ſhall be drowned in that pool: in theſe baths of brimſtone they ſhall ſwimme and ſweat and be throughly drenched for their cleanſing. The greatneſs of this may be beſt learned from experience; if the water of a fiſh-pond were all drawn out, and the fiſh for ſome dayes ſpace were not removed; they would fill the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29880:46"/>air with ſuch incredible ſtench; that no one, though in the open air, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to abide long there.</p>
                  <p>What a torment will it be in hell, to be ſeated in the midſt of unſufferable ſtink, without power to ſtir one foot thence for all eternity? long cuſtome makes tollerable ſorded and ill ſented trades: but thoſe torments in hell can by no means become more gentle.</p>

                  <p>THe third cauſe of that ſtink is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the damned, more noyſome then any dead carkaſe. <hi>Eſay</hi> foretold: <hi>Out of their carcaſses ſhall riſe a ſtink.</hi> All of them ſhall be tortured with the ſtink of one, and one with that of all.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:29880:47"/>in matter and corruption, he privately made his own. Thence returning back to his poor cottage, this well-ſented booty he placed as a Looking-glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes: where ſeveral times ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at himſelf, he ſaid: Lo thou ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

Thus luſt, though never ſo Rampant, was conquered by ſtink: thus <hi>Cupid,</hi> that skilful and wicked Archer, by ſtench was routed and put to flight.</p>
                  <p>Let us call to mind here, I beſeech you, how not a ſmall parcel of a winding ſheet, not one member of a rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, but innumerable bodies of the damned ſend forth moſt intollerable ſtink not for a few daies, but for endleſs ages.</p>

How then in hell ſhall he for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abide the ſtink of Devils and all that damned crue?</p>

                     <hi>Mezentius</hi> the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> King, not unlike to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> deſpiſer of men and Gods, proceeded ſo far in cruelty by his wit, that he ſlaughtered men not with the Ax, nor the Gallows, nor fire, but with ſtench: for to a living man he tyed the putrified body of one dead, ſo long, till the corruption of the dead killed the living. A kind of torment moſt Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, moſt cruel, and ſo much the more, by how much the ſlower.

The Gates which by reaſon of their ſtraitneſs ſcarcely gave way for a Mans body, were kept cloſe lockt. At the ſide was a narrow win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, no bigger then a good trencher, wherein the Guard put in meat for the Captives. About the Priſon was a way eight handfuls broad, whereon was a double Palizado compacted of thick and long ſtakes, ſharp at the ends and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the top with thornes: hereat no entrance was allowed, but at one place. Beſides, houſes were erected in two ſeveral places, one for the Court of Guard which ſtood Centinel day and night; the other for the Captains ſervice,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29880:50"/>who frequently commanded the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to walk the round.

With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Fortreſs lived ſo many years that illuſtrious Champion of Chriſt, without having liberty to ſet foot out of the pales, which the Guard refuſed to grant him. Other circumſtances of cruelty, appertaining to this Priſon, can hardly be conceived, much leſs declared: all the ſenſes of the body were conſtrained to undergo their ſeveral Torments.</p>
                  <p>Mervailous was the ſtraitneſs of the place, where one could neither lye down without difficulty, nor walk one ſtep forward: ſo much do <hi>Charles</hi> his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters teſtifie; <hi>We are kept in great ſtraits, no one being allowed more ſpace, then two hands breadth and four inches:</hi> whence in the night time they could not ſtretch themſelves out to take their reſt.</p>
                  <p>Their Victuals were as ſtrait as their room: their life was a continual faſt, and that ſo ſtrict, that they had meat enough to keep them alive, but not to ſatisfie their hunger: their ordinary dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were a few diſhes of cold Rice, boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fair water; beſides one meſs of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29880:50"/>Sedges or Gladen, which is a mixture of unſavory herbs, ſo bitter, as it could ſcarcely be eaten: hereunto was added a ſmall pittance of raw and falt roots, or a couple of ſalt herring either hot, or cold. Hereupon the Priſoners were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſo much with famine, that when the ſouldiers threw them a hard cruſt of ill made and worſe baked bread, they fed upon it as greedily, as if it had been March-pane, or Sugar-cakes.</p>
                  <p>Now in regard this Priſon was ſeated on the ſummit of a high hill, it lay all open to all injuries of weather: and though in ſummer the winds gently breathing did ſomwhat abate their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the violent heats of the Sun heating on them upon every ſide, and the great number of priſoners, did not a little encreaſe their miſery: this made <hi>Charles</hi> affirm, he was continually moiſt with ſweat both day and night.</p>
                  <p>Thus were they vexed with ſummer, but in the winter their ſufferings were intolerable; becauſe they were neither ſheltered from the ſharpneſs of the air, nor from the ſhowers of rain, nor abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſnow, which the wind blew in amongſt them. They were more ſenſible of piercing cold, for that they ſtood in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29880:51"/>great want of clothes, which the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would by no means permit to be brought in to them. Thus much <hi>Charles</hi> writ to father Provincial, ſaying: <hi>I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your Reverence, here is none of us, who regarding only the inferiour appetite, would not rather be burnt alive, then endure this Priſon: Since none of us have ſcarſely rags to hide our nakedneſs; neither will our keepers afford us ſo much as a piece of a Matt, to defend us from wind, rain and ſnow; whereby our Cold is wholly unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ambroſe Fernandez,</hi> threeſcore and nine years old, and <hi>Charles</hi> his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Priſon, being ſeized with a Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie through abundance of ſnow; in twelve hours time, as it is reported, made an end of his Diſeaſe and Life together.</p>
                  <p>Moreover leſt that the eyes ſhould want their torment too, the watch would not ſuffer any light at all in the Priſon; no, not ſo much as a Lanthorn that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry night when <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was ſuddenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his fit, though <hi>Charles</hi> earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſought them to let him have a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                  <p>But that which did more terribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Champions of Chriſt, was the continual ſtench, whereof we treat; and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29880:51"/>of which <hi>Charles</hi> makes mention in a certain Epiſtle, ſaying: <hi>The grievouſneſs of ſtink forceth me to ſigh up to heaven.</hi> This ſtink aroſe from that crowd of men in ſo narrow a Priſon, from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air, and from their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements they were compelled to keep amongſt them, and from the ſweat of their bodies, from which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver free all Summer. The Souldiers were ſo barbarous, as not to ſuffer them to have clean linnen brought in, or to let them waſh their foul: in ſo much, that it is particularly related of <hi>Charles,</hi> that in three whole years he neither changed his ſhirt, nor apparel. Hence ſo much filth and vermine ſwarmed amongſt them, that the diſtreſſed Captives through biting and ſtinging of inſects were wholly deprived of reſt. And that they might experience alive, what the dead without feeling endure after death, they were covered from head to foot with all ſorts of vermine bred in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the place: which corrupt matter, ſo often as it rained, overflowed the pavement of the Priſon. A kind of torment far more cruel, then at firſt ſight it appears. Againſt all theſe incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they had no other remedy, but Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:29880:52"/>and a lively truſt in God: their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience was ſo great, that <hi>Charles</hi> in a certain Letter affirms:

                  <p>HEre now, I beſeech you, let us make uſe of diſcourſe to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Imagin hell to be nothing elſe, but a loathſome and ſtarving priſon, where a thouſand Captives for ſtench and vermine can neither ſit nor lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, where their meat is rotten Rice, and drink muddy Water; where they cannot ſleep for famine, ſtink and pain; and that all this ſhould continue a thouſand years: Imagin, I ſay, that hell is but ſuch a Priſon as this: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, who would not tremble
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:29880:52"/>at the very name of this hell? But if the matter be well ſcanned, and weighed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is revealed in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it will manifeſtly appear, that the moſt loathſom priſons in <hi>Japonia,</hi> or any other barbarous nation, compared to hell, maybe reputed a floriſhing Garden, the delights of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> or <hi>Paradiſe</hi> it ſelf. The reaſon is clear: In our priſons we have ſome meat, ſleep, and time to reſt; in hell is neither meat, ſleep, nor reſt; there corrupt Rice would taſt like Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſia, puddle Water would drink like Nectar. In our priſons none ever count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand winters; in hell (which is moſt ſad) a hundred thouſand years ſtrike not off one tittle from eternity: after a thouſand millions of ages eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is entire.</p>
                  <p>Again, Our priſons, though dreadful, yet are they without fire, and the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have a ſingular comfort, that they can die: the Dennes of the damned are full of flames, and are not free from the ſecond death: becauſe in hell death is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent, but death without death, and a continual death which laſts for ever.</p>

                  <p>It is here worth our frequent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions reflection, to know what the holy Scripture means, in propoſing unto us

Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in old time ſcarce met with any puniſhment more barbarous, then with a ſlow fire to burn and roaſt men alive. Fire is the worſt and moſt grievous of puniſhments.</p>
               <p>If any one guilty of treaſon, or other heinous crimes, could be ſo burnt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, that his pain endured but for an hour; then it might be rightly ſaid: Fire is the worſt of torments.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:29880:56"/>to be burnt a thouſand times alive! this diſmal ſentence (to burn a thouſand hours) would ſeem more gentle to the damned, then a free grant of life would be to one ſpeedily to be beheaded.</p>
               <p>But the decree is firm and ſtable, it cannot be changed or recal'd: the words of Chriſt are moſt plain: <hi>Go into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire.</hi> All Churches of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome openly teach, the wicked muſt be tormented with flames eternal.</p>
               <p>This then is the fifth torment in hell, fire eternal, whereof we will diſcourſe according to our ability in this preſent chapter.</p>

The like is obſerved by our Saviour in his moſt divine exhortations; ſo <hi>Mark</hi> 9. preaching to the People, he ſaid: <hi>It is good for thee to enter into life maimed, then having two hands to go into hell, into the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29880:57"/>fire unquenchable, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quencheth not.</hi> He was not weary with repeating the ſame thrice in one place; for a while after he ſays: <hi>It is good for thee to enter into life, lame, rather then having two feet, to be caſt into the hell of unquenchable fire, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quencheth not.</hi> Laſtly he iterates the ſame: <hi>It is good for thee with one eye to enter into the Kingdom of God, rather then having two eyes, to be caſt into the hell of fire, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Canticle Chriſt our Lord ſung before them: as if he had ſaid, ſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me: Where their worm dyeth not, and the fire quencheth not. Who would not be terrified with ſo dreadful threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the mouth of God? Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs, he that often with attention ſings this doleful verſe, in a better world ſhall ſing for ever, a joyful Alleluia. This one teſtimony were abundantly ſufficient, though the ſacred Oracles of Scripture ſpoke no more.</p>
                  <p>The difference betwixt hell fire and ours is moſt notorious, and firſt in the manner of burning. Our fire ſeems to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> painted; that other real: a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29880:57"/>ſo palpable, that there ſcarcely remains any likeneſs betwixt a true and painted flame. Here, I beſeech you, let us proceed leiſurely to the matter in hand.</p>
                  <p>How extream and ſharp a pain is it, to have the end of the finger burnt only for half an hour in a ſlender Wax light? how much greater to have the whole hand burnt? But what unſpeakable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have the whole body? albeit the fire that burns ſeem only paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In <hi>Japonia</hi> this preſent age we live in, Chriſtians were moſt cruelly tormented with ſlow fire: amongſt theſe <hi>Charles Spinola</hi> was one, of whom in the precedent Chapter: He with three and twenty more underwent his tryal in this ſort. A fire was made twenty five hands off from the Pillars, to which the Martyrs were tyed, that the pain might be ſo much the ſharper, by how much the longer; and that they might be gently roaſted, ere they were burnt. If the fire chanced to break out of any ſide, it was ſtreight way forced in again. The Chriſtians were nor bound in chains, but with Oſier-twigs, and that in a looſe and careleſs manner: this was done out of the Devils ſubtilty, to the end the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29880:58"/>Champions of Chriſt, forced through extremity of torment, might eaſily break their bands, and ſodeliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from flames: where this as a ſigne, was agreed upon amongſt the Barbarians, that whoever endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſcape the flames, ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have renounced Chriſt.

So it is written, <hi>Machabees</hi> c. 5. <hi>Antiochus being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in mind, conſidered not, that for the ſins of them that inhabit the City, God had been angry a little.</hi> God indeed is angry a little, however he lift up his arms and ſeem to threaten ſtripes in good earneſt: his anger is yet little, becauſe joyned with clemency. But when this anger is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:29880:61"/>contemned, and clemency ſleighted, then patience offended becomes fury, whereby fire is kindled to burn for ever. You, ſaith God, your ſelves kindled this fire, when by your often iterated crimes you deſpiſed my clemency: when my anger was little, you were impatient; you tranſgreſſed my Laws, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt fell upon what was forbidden.

                  <p>HEre I moſt earneſtly begge of all Chriſtians, that when any ſickneſs or pain accoſts them, when the Gout, Stone, or any other malady or trouble moleſts them, they would lay hold on this thought: this affliction, or pain, were it to endure ten, a hundred, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, would you not think you were already in hell? What would you do then to be ſet free? Do that now to eſcape eternal torments. And know for certain the trouble you ſuffer, though grievous; the pain you endure, though exceſſive, is not ſo much as a ſhaddow of hell. Here God ſtrikes with one hand only, and that gently; there he ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with both, and that moſt ſeverely: here he often lays but one finger on you, there with all his fingers, yea and the whole hand too he lays load on.</p>

I hold ſome gnaſhing the teeth, others quaking and trembling all over from head to foot: then throwing my ſelf
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:29880:62"/>upon the ground, and taking up duſt. I beg of God, I may never make tryal of thoſe miſeries. In like manner I look upon that immenſe Sea of boyling fire, whole waves flow too and fro, and roar exceedingly; ſo as ſome may imagin, they aſcend even to heaven: in that dreadful Sea, innumerable men are plunt ged, who jointly with one voice cry and howl in ſuch ſort, as no one ever heard upon earth: they all of them burn, like withered ſticks; the mercy of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forſaken them, to give place to his Juſtice.

                  <p>'Tis a maxime amongſt Phyſitians: Fire is a remedy againſt Fire, for if the finger or hand chance to be burned, 'tis a preſent cure to apply it to the fire, or candle-light: thus fire through likeneſs will to fire.

                  <p>The reaſon hereof is at hand: When adverſity environs us on every ſide, when heaven and earth conſpire to trouble us, we may take our refuge to God: tho none comfort us, God is aboundant ſolace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us.

Heaven is ſhut up, hell is ſhut up, none may paſs hence thither: it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: that heavenly banket was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis now irrecoverable, there remains no hope of beatitude.</p>

                  <p>If one hunger-ſtarved ſee a table well furniſhed with dainties, but dare not touch a bit, he becomes more hungry; eſpecially if through his own fault he be barred from eating.

Their conſcience therefore will ſo afflict them, as not to give them leave to think on any thing

                  <p>THe ſecond thing, which conſcience ſhall upbraid the damned with, is Neglect of Vertue and a multitude of crimes. The conſcience will rehearſe, as out of a ſcrowl, all that was ill done, and all that was careleſly omitted. Whence they will condemn themſelves of wicked folly; each ones Conſcience caſting ſloth in their teeth, will ſay. How often ſhouldſt thou have prayed, when thy time paſſed in ſleep, or play? Thy prayers were ſeldom, ſluggiſh and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ones: thou payeſt for it now. How often ſhouldſt thou have faſted, when thou choſe rather to feaſt, then obey? but now chou payeſt for it. How often, without prejudice to thy eſtate, might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou have given alms, when thou was more addicted to avarice, then mercy? thou ſuffers for it now. How often was
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:29880:69"/>thou warned, how often craved to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thine enemies, and like a good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian forget injuries, but thou wouldeſt not? thou art puniſhed for it now. How often amidſt croſſes was patience recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to thee, but thou refuſe to be patient? therefore thou art now chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. How often mighteſt thou have practiſed humility and charity, which needed but a good will; no labour, no running, ſweat or ſtarving was required here; this might have been done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whipping, hair-cloth, or other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, but thou refuſed? thou art now juſtly ſcourged. How often was reaſon brought to invite, to draw thee to the right uſe of Sacraments, but thou wouldeſt not be perſwaded to it? ſuffer hardly. Opportunity was never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, thou alwayes to it: thou hadſt power, but wouldeſt not: pay now, pay for thy wickedneſs.

                  <p>Open thine eyes, thou ſordid ſlave, to behold, how thou haſt loſt all, for wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in impurity but a moment. Thou art now remote from the honours, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights of the bleſſed, which 'tis impoſſible for thee ever to attain. Thy luſt has plunged thee into this abyſs of torments, thy incontinency has drawn upon thee theſe unquenchable flames: that merry and ſhort madneſs of thine is waited on by eternal mourning. Doſt thou deplore the privation of Paradiſe? thou haſt deprived thy ſelf. Doſt thou bewail the joys of heaven were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? thou didſt neglect them. Doſt thou lament that heaven gates are ſhut? thou didſt ſhut them againſt thy ſelf. At this very inſtant thou mightſt have been

It was eaſie to have merited heaven, but delays, and careleſs negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence have brought thee hither, blind and mad as thou art, whence thou mayſt not go out for eternity. Here is no free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no ſalvation: deſpair a hundred, a thouſand times, deſpair eternally, dye eternally, yet thou canſt never meet with death after infinite ages. Thou art caſt away from the face of God, becauſe thou averted thy ſelf from him. Thou periſheſt by no ones fault, but thine own; periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Such Sermons as theſe the Conſcience makes, but too late: all hope is turned into deſpair.</p>
                  <p>A timely pennance is ſo efficacious, that it blots out all ſins; and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſins forgiven, or at leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth it; beſides, it augments the favour of God. For this reaſon, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the deſert St. <hi>John,</hi> inſtiled this one thing into the ears of thoſe that reſorted to him: <hi>Do pennance for the Kingdom of heaven is at hand, Mat.</hi> 3.

The foulneſs of intemperance is abominable to them; the Lethergy of ſloth, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of voluptuouſneſs, the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of impure love they execrate; but all this comes too late.

                     <hi>Job</hi> made a wiſe wiſh when he ſaid: <hi>Who will grant me, that I may be according to the former moneths, when I waſhed my feet with butter, and the rock powered me rivers of oyl? Job</hi> 29.2.6. It is ſcarce credible how much it gauls, to be tumbled down from the height of plenty to the ebb of poverty. The damned know well, that formerly they rowed in abundance. They had right to heaven, they might if they would, have inherited that bleſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. They remember the butter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace flowed plentifully to them, wherein they might have bathed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they refuſed it. They appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend moſt lively, that rivers of oyl from the rock, and fountains of divine love and mercy were ſtreamed upon them by Chriſt: all which through their own fault they neglected. Now they cry out, but in vain: Who will grant us that we may be according to the former months, when we waſhed, or might waſh, our feet with butter, and the rock
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:29880:71"/>Chriſt powered out rivers of oyl, of his precious blood? now neither one drop of oyl, nor butter runs any more. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Gods mercy is dried up: the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of divine grace ſtream not at all. The blood of the heavenly Lamb was ſhed in vain for us; the pains and death of Chriſt avail us nothing; all done for us is bootleſs: alas! we are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>

O hours eſtimable above gold, whither are you gone, never to return!

                  <p>THe force of conſcience is incredible, eſpecially after the ſcene of this life is acted: for in the preſence of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one will ſo bluſh at his own faults, that though heaven were ſet open, and the ſoul uncleanſed were invited to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nevertheleſs through horror of its own ſtains it would fly back, and refuſe to go in, till all its ſpots were expiated.

                  <p>Therefore while we have time, let us work good to all: for as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes: Who ever doth not deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by flattery, underſtands well, in how great danger of eternal death, and how far ſhort of perfect holineſs he lives du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his pilgrimage here on earth.</p>

                  <hi>CAto Cenſor,</hi> A man of approved vertue was accuſtomed to give this admonition to them, who were about to buy Land, that in the firſt place they ſhould be ſure to provide for good neighbours. An ill neighbour, is a great evil: whence that ſaying of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> delivered by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is well known; for, having a farm to ſell he commanded the cryer, who gave notice of the ſale, he ſhould likewiſe certifie, <hi>That it had good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:29880:76"/>A ruinous and inconvenient build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if it be near bad company, will meet with few buyers.</p>
               <p>All exiled from heaven have ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of abode, that our ſtyes, and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennels compared to them, might ſeem places or lodgings fit for Kings. Beſides, the inconveniency of the place, there is company diſpleaſing beyond expreſſion, of ſo many millions of devils and damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, all ſworn enemies to God, ſo as, if they were in Paradiſe; they would make one abhor it.</p>
               <p>This then is the ſeventh torment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in hell, the place and company; that miſerable above meaſure, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable beyond imagination. The Judg in his definitive ſentence comprehended both, ſaying: This houſe of flames, this dreadful priſon, which was prepared for the devil and his angels, did not concern you in the beginning:

               <p>In like manner Chriſt ſpeaks to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: My intent was you ſhould have enjoyed the ſociety of Angels; Paradiſe was made ready for you: but ſince you have caſt away all goodneſs, and would not obey me, but the devil: Go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, go, go, and make your abode in the devils den; remain in that company your ſelves have provided.

                  <p>BEfore we enter into the Place, lets take a view of the ground. Antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently at the left hand of the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Yrimalcions</hi> houſe, not far from the Porters lodg, was painted upon the wall a mighty dog in a chain, over whom was written in Capital Letters; Take heed, take heed of the dog.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuch dogs as theſe are in hell: ſo many <hi>Cerberus's,</hi> as devils, which are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:29880:77"/>far more ravenous then all <hi>Cerberus's.</hi> Here both by writing and words I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim: Take heed, take heed of theſe dogs. But now let us look upon the place.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed upon as well by antient Fathers, as Divines, that thoſe comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs caverns of hell are ſeated in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth: holy writt likewiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the ſame. For after they, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt <hi>Moyſes,</hi> were ſeparated from the people of God:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 16, v 32</note> 
                     <hi>The earth brake in ſunder under their feet: &amp; opening her mouth, devoured them with their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, and all their ſubſtance: and they went down into hell quick covered with the ground.</hi> This priſon of the wicked is rightly ſeated in the loweſt place, as the habitation of the bleſſed is on the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, nobleſt, and moſt pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Of that priſon we may frame this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: In caſe the damned amount to thirty times a thouſand millions of men, or a hundred thouſand millions and that fiery priſon according to its whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menfion of height, bredth and length contain one <hi>German</hi> mile, it will have room enough for that wonderful num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men. Streitneſs ſutes well with the priſon; it being proper for liberty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29880:78"/>to enjoy an ample habitation. But the croud of the damned, thoſe dogs and ſwine, ſhall dwell in a narrow compaſs, and ſhall be like grapes in a wine preſs, or ſalt harrings in a barrel, or bricks in a kill, or pieces of wood in a pyle, or hot glowing coles in an iron-grate, or like ſheep butcher'd in the ſhambles; they ſhall be cloſe and ſtreitly thronged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The narrowneſs of the priſon, and their being preſſed one near to another, makes no ſmall addition to their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Into this ſlender compaſs God will conveigh all the ſewers and filth of the world.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt joy this world affords is not a little diminiſht by loathſomneſs of place. Who would eſteem it a pleaſure to take up his quarters for any long time in a tallow-chandlers, or curriers ſhop, in <hi>Augias</hi> ſtable, or in a vault filled with rotten carcaſſes? ſo ungrateful a place as this, by reaſon of its ſtench, would quite baniſh out of the breaſt all thoughts of pleaſure. What then will happen in that forge of Gods wrath, in that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cave of eternity, wherce all joy is removed, and where there is nothing to be found, but extream dolours? How much will this deep, obſcure and ſtench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:29880:78"/>place increaſe their pains? yea, what I tremble to think of, a place moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from heaven, and cloſely ſhut up with a thouſand locks, iron grates, and perculliſes?</p>

                  <p>To this purpoſe I call to mind a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which paſſed betwixt two inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends; the one whereof might well be termed <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> the other <hi>Pylades:</hi> this demanded to know, in what manner he might beſt repreſent to himſelf that dungeon of the damned. Whereunto <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes</hi> replyed, in my judgment, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to be performed in this ſort: Let ſome one, in the ſpring or autumn, when the ſeaſon of the year is ſharpeſt, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down into the bottom of a deep pit under ground, where there is neither fire, nor table, nor bed. Hither once a day let a cruſt of mouldy-hard bread, with a ſmall cup of ſtinking water, be
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:29880:81"/>caſt down by a rope: this dainty fare muſt likewiſe be ſeaſoned with reading this lecture, that the party ſo enthralled is without ceaſing to meditate on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity both day and night. Well, ſaid <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades:</hi> I deem that an efficacious way to imprint eternity in the mind. Yet oblige me with a further courteſie, and make me partaker of a more ample diſcourſe touching the man before mentioned.</p>

                  <p>THat man in the beginning will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem three weeks as irkſome, as three whole years: and if he chance to be reſtored again to his liberty, he will openly profeſs his ſufferings were exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. What were his ſufferings I pray? hunger, thirſt, cold, want of ſleep, with privation of all comfort. Hitherto the miſcreant ſays true. But obſerve, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, how tolerable this priſon is, how plentiful his diet, what freedom he ſeems to enjoy, when you look down upon that cloſe impriſonment in hell: he had his ſhare of meat and drink to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his life, in hell is neither one drop, nor crum of comfort.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:29880:82"/>
                  <p>Beſides no one derided that poor man in the pit, none inſulted over him, no one loaded him with ſtripes; whereas in hell they are perpetually oppreſſed with all theſe calamities.</p>
                  <p>Again, that ſilly wretch might paſſe over the day in quiet and the night in reſt, though both were accompanied with difficulty; but in hell is not ſo much as one ſole minute of eaſe, or ſleep to be found.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that mans breſt was not torn to pieces with ſadneſs; all grief, horror amazement, howling, anguiſh and deſpair did not any ways afflict him: as they do inceſſantly them in hell.</p>
                  <p>That mans thraldom was free from torments, he was moleſted with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſe then hunger, thirſt and cold: but the damned are racked in all the members of their bodies, and their ſouls being drencht in affliction always live in flames and never dye: this death is more bitter to them then death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In a word, albeit that Caitif be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from delights, though he behold no ſun, haven o company, but be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred all ſport and relaxation of mind;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:29880:82"/>yet he cherriſhes this hope in his boſom, that one day he ſhall enjoy himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he ſhall ſee the ſuns face, meet with his beloved companions, and return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh to his accuſtomed paſtimes and delights. Whereas, God wot, all their hope in hell is changed into deſpair: they know certainly at their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thither, they muſt never look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſun any more, they muſt never meet again either with their wiſhed for company, or content. The ſight of God, the ſociety of Angels, together with all celeſtial pleaſure is quite taken from them eternally without hope of recovery: Deſpair lives in hell, as at home; it ſpares none of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.

                  <p>A Learned man of St. <hi>Dominicks</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der recounts this paſſage to my preſent purpoſe:
<note place="margin">Joan Junier.</note> A Jeſter, ſays he, a nimble-witted buffon, in an aſſembly of noble men, took upon him to play the preacher, whom he had heard that morning; and with an intent to draw mirth out of ſerious matters he thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his Sermon: You know, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, how much my company conduceth to your jovial entertainment; whether you be carouſing, feaſting, gaming or dancing I am ſtill, as the fool in the play, ready to chear you up. But liſten, I beſeech you, to what lately befel me: as I lay upon a down bed and could not ſleep, I began to think with my ſelf: if thou wert ſo faſt bound here for twenty, or thirty years ſpace, that thou couldeſt neither ſtir hand, nor foot. what wouldſt thou do to purchaſe liberty? How if thou couldſt riot otherwiſe obtain it, then by bidding adieu to all company keeping and not? I ſaid to my ſelf, nay I would ſwear it (if need required) that I would utterly forſwear all my pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companions, all jollity, play and dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:29880:83"/>rather then be in this ſort debarred of my freedom. But ſay, I pray thee, what courſe wouldeſt thou take, if thou wert in <hi>Pluto's</hi> Court; not buried in feathers, but flames; not amidſt ripplers, but devils; where all chatting for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is wholly forbidden, where one ſmall drop of water is no leſs precious, then a celler ſtored with the choiceſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: whither one may enter, as beaſts did to the ſick Lyon, whoſe footſteps you might behold all going in, but none coming out again? To go down into hell is an eaſie matter; but who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen to have returned thence? Now then if thou wert there, tell me ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what wouldeſt thou do?</p>
                  <p>His Sermon being thus ended, he found himſelf ſo ſuddenly changed; that one might juſtly perſwade himſelf, he was become another <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> who played the Jeſter to <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperor; and who, whiles acting upon the ſtage, he ſcoffed at the rites of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, found himſelf ſuddenly changed into another man, and openly profeſt he was a chriſtian: yea and as a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an obtained the crown of Martyrdome with the loſs of his head. So ſerious concluſions follow out of jeſting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes:

As the bleſſed in heaven will be repleniſht with unexplicable delight when they behold Chriſt the worlds Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, his moſt glorious Mother and Diſciples, together with ſo many Quires of Angels, and millions of triumphant Saints: So the reprobate will receive an addition to their horrid torments from that execrable company, from which they ſhall never be delivered. What ſentiment wouldſt thou be of, if ſound
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:29880:84"/>and in health, thou ſhould be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lodg night and day in the ſame Hoſpital with ſick folks covered over with ulcers, ſores and rottenneſs? What if thou ſhouldſt ſee their limms flowing in their own putrified matter and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?

O what a hell, ſaiſt thou, would this life be! Nay, how meer a nothing would this be compared to hell! that, which thou calleſt ſtench, would ſmell like bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; theſe moans would be harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous muſick; that pain thou ſpeakeſt of, would prove a play-game; it is a paradiſe indeed, thou lookeſt on as a hell. For if it be troubleſome to converſe with a few who hate thee; what may be imagined more grievous, then to abide there, where no one loves another, but every ones breaſt boyles with hatred towards each other?</p>
                  <p>Theſe faſhions are in requeſt in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Court; all burn with ſuch deadly hatred, that, if it were in their power, they would tear one another peice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:29880:85"/>with their teeth. For theſe inmates of hell extreamly abhor the image of God both in themſelves and others: yea, as they have an exceſſive ſpleen againſt God, ſo they have a tooth againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that reſembles him.

                  <p>You would eaſily imagine, this unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable company might be of force ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to make us eſcheſh the wicked meetings of drunkards, gameſters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:29880:85"/>perſons, and laſcivious talkers, whoſe vices often ſtick cloſe to ſuch, as communicate with them: eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ought to beware, leſt we hurt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by our bad example. Chriſt makes this publick proclamation to the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Wo be to the world for ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals: he that ſhall ſcandalize one of theſe little ones that believe in me, it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him that a Milſtone be hanged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his neck and that he be drowned in the depths of the ſea.

               <p>THe antient <hi>Thebans</hi> mervailed, that the common-wealth of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did ſo flouriſh, that their Citizens were kept in ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as vices were ſeldom heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Hereupon they ſent <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> the Philoſopher to pry into their proceedings, and to bring back in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:29880:86"/>what he obſerved either concerning their laws, or government. <hi>Philonius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving curiouſly marked all particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Thebes,</hi> where being to give an account of his Embaſſy in publick, he laid open upon the Theatre, rods, ſnares, whips, racks, axes, wheels, and gibbets; then after ſome time of ſilence, he broke forth into theſe words: Behold, quoth he, and become eye-witneſſes, you <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> Citizens, what keeps the <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> in order: no one offends amongſt them, who is not forthwith chaſtiſed: vertue goes not without reward, nor vice free from puniſhment: hence it is, their manners are better then ours.</p>
               <p>God, the worlds law-giver, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wiſdom performs his part; and that orderly diſcipline may not go to wrack, he does not threaten gibbets, racks, nor wheels; but hell fire, which burns for ever. Nevertheleſs (ſuch is mans impiety) the world dares ſtil tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the laws of God: what, I pray, would not mans boldneſs attempt, if they were only puniſhable for an hour, or a day; or to be impriſoned for a year or two? To all ſuch as ſwerve from Gods commands, we know, thraldom without end, pains eternal are decreed;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29880:87"/>and yet (which cannot be ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wonder,) tranſgreſſors of divine laws are Numberleſs.</p>
               <p>VVhence, (I beſeech you) doth this incredible temerity proceed? <hi>The fear of God is not before their eyes, Pſalm</hi> 13. becauſe the mercy of God, ſo often as men offend, hinders him from throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Thunder-bolts upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, therefore they become auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious above meaſure: whence many void of fear trample the ordinations of Heaven under foot, and looſe the reins to wickedneſs forbidden. A deceitful hope ſooths many up, and leads them inſenſibly into the gulf of deſpair; which is that torment of eternity we now treat of.</p>

                  <p>HOpe in this world is an admirable lenitive for all ſorts of affliction, and miſeries whatever: it may fitly be termed a Soveraign oyntment, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſes all our aggrievances. Hope chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regards <hi>profit and the end:</hi> though tears trickle down abundantly, yet they are eaſily wiped away with this ſpunge. Thoſe noble champions of Chriſt, thoſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:29880:87"/>invincible Martyrs, though they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, yet were they much comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the fruits of patience. The like ſolace are they partakers of (to ſpeak with St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) who do good and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer evil.</p>
                  <p>It happens ſometimes that one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes a Farm, for which he pays many thouſand crowns, and yet for all that ſays, he doth not repent him of his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe all his charges will in time come back again with intereſt. Their torments in hell are exceedingly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that their ſufferings bring them in no profit: whereas with us one ſmall tear, ſo it be ſerious, is able to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many heinous offences: it is not ſo with them, for, albeit their pains be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo grievous, yet do they not expiat one venial ſin, nor deſerve ſo much as a drop of water.</p>
                  <p>How heavy a burden is it for peſants and labourers to work without wages! So is all toyl without hope of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.

                  <p>Some indeed deſpair, and that but once, becauſe death allows them no longer time. But in hell they deſpair a thouſand times an hour, yea their deſpair is without ceaſing, like unto a continual or hectick feaver.

                  <p>In this world of ours no malady ſo great, but has its remedy: all affliction may, if we will, be mitigated. Our grief is frequently appeaſed by reaſon, by reſt, by pleaſing converſation, and chiefly by proceſs of time: one while our friends and kindred, another while ſuch as have ſuffered the like diſaſters, but principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope either wipes away, or aſſwages our Calamity. Whereas, God knows, in that region of utter deſolation all gates are ſhut to the leaſt ſolace: No eaſe no comfort may be expected from heaven, or earth; from their condition paſt, preſent, or to come. What way ſoever they turn their eyes, they behold
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:29880:89"/>arrows of eternal death ſhot againſt them.

                  <p>THis deſpair of the wicked will be augmented above meaſure by the certain knowledge they have, that with all their unſpeakable ſufferings not the leaſt blemiſh of ſin may be waſht away: ſuch is the venom of one mortal ſin, that even venial defects accompanying it to hell muſt be chaſtiſed for ever. Take this example: our ordinary failings are, idle words, effuſed laughter, ſome ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in diet, careleſneſs in the caſtody of our eyes, diſtraction in prayer: theſe and ſuch like, while we live, are caſily expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. One morſel for borne to curb our appetite, one gentle ſigh, a litle patience, or an eaſie keeping our hands or eyes in order, blot out thoſe leſſer ſtains: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they be joined with one heinous crime in hell, both ſhall be puniſht eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:29880:90"/>which adds no ſmall fuel to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle the fire of deſpair.</p>
                  <p>We muſt needs acknowledge, in this life the hand of God is armed with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he ſtrikes: but in the other 'tis heavier then lead, harder then iron, and when extended to revenge, he never pulls it in again.</p>
                  <p>The deſpair, we ſpeak of, ariſeth from hope in exceſs, which is called preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this the wiſe man warns us to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew: <hi>Say not: I have ſinned, and what ſorrowful thing hath chanced to me? for the higheſt is a patient rewarder. Of ſin forgiven be not without fear, neither add thou ſin upon ſin. And ſay not: The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my ſins.

                  <p>TO ſome we ſaid Eternity was a dream, but a dreadful one: for who is become ſo flinty as not to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with eternity, though it appear onely in ſleep? yet foraſmuch as they look upon it as a dream, they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it not, they make no reckning of it, they let it not ſink into their brains, nor weigh it in its proper balance: whence they quickly forget it, ſuch as theſe are noted by <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> c. 34. <hi>The dreams of them that do evil, are vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon Eaſter day ſome devout women went to the monument of our Lord to annoint him, whom they thought ſtill dead: but when the Angels which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in white, told them he was alive, they returned back from the Sepulcher, and related what they had heard and ſeen, for joyful tydings to the Apoſtles, <hi>And theſe words,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Luke</hi> ch. 24. <hi>ſeemed before them as dotage, and they did not believe them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much after this ſame faſhion it fares with us: Is not eternity frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, plainly enough, diſtinctly enough ſet before our eyes, and inculcated unto
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:29880:104"/>us, by ſermons, pictures, exhortations, pious diſcourſes and ſpiritual books? But what affect, I pray, hath all this? Theſe things ſeem before many as dotage; or a dream. They are ſtrook with fear for a while, but anon together with their dream fear likewiſe vaniſheth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jonas</hi> the Prophet, unwilling to obey Gods commands, betook himſelf to the ſea: where the Marriners trembling at the danger of a horrible tempeſt, fell to their prayers, and to diſburden the ſhip, they threw over board ſuch wares, as they were laden with. Mean while <hi>Jonas</hi> dreaming of no danger lay faſt aſleep under deck: here the maſter of the veſſel finds and awakens him, ſaying: <hi>Why art thou oppreſſed with ſleep? Riſe, invocate thy God, if perhaps God will think of us, and we periſh not, Jon.</hi> c. 1. By and by upon mutual conſent they drew lots, and the lot falling upon <hi>Jonas,</hi> he was caſt into the ſea, the reſt, who had thrown their goods into the water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping.</p>
                  <p>While we live, we ſail in a tattered and leeking ſhip through a ſtormy and raging ſea; where we are as near to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as Marriners to the water: we are often three fingers diſtant from death,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:29880:104"/>though many times not ſo much: one breathing ſpace ſufficeth to act that, which an entire eternity cannot expiate: We are frequently minded of the danger we live in, by one who ſpeaks to us in this ſort: Why art thou oppreſſed with ſleep? Riſe, invocate God. He that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his ſalvation, ſhakes off drowſineſs, ariſes from the place of his repoſe, and throws over board ſuch ladeing, as would hinder his ſafety: I mean, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to prayer, faſting, and almeſ deeds; and chooſes rather to looſe all, then not to do pennance in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for his ſins.</p>
                  <p>Contrary-wiſe how many be found, who refuſing to ſubmit to the will of God, are in ſuch a dead ſleep, as not to hear what peril is threatned by the roaring tempeſt? to theſe kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eternity ſeems but a fable, or a dream.

                  <p>ETernity of the damned is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beyond expreſſion. Imagine this puniſhment were accompanied with theſe four inconveniencies: Let a Bee ſting your right hand, a Gnat ſuck your left; let a Beetle ſeiſe upon your right, cheek, and a pricking thorn ranckle in the left: admit theſe alone were the pains in hell, or any one of theſe.

                     <hi>Lydwine,</hi> a moſt religious Virgin, a mirrour of patience and all kind of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, endured moſt piercing Diſeaſes eight and thirty years, with patience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to her pain. To this Saint with much adoe was brought a man grown to that height of impiety, that he could by no means be drawn to lay open his ſins in Confeſſion. But at length with much difficulty they wrought upon him ſo farr, that he was content to diſcover in ſome ſort the wounds of his conſcience to <hi>Lydwine,</hi> who had already one foot in the Grave, and beg of her a remedy for them. He, as it is uſual for ſuch brutes to do, making a jeſt of it, came to the ſick Virgin; and that he might prove as good as his word, he began in a laughing manner to rehearſe a large Catalogue of his ſins. The Saint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him by all the heavenly court, he would give over the rehearſal of thoſe things to her, which ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to a Prieſt, and which others without offence could not give ear to. Nevertheleſs as he began, ſo he went on
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29880:114"/>with his ſtory; where, after a long reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, he told her, it was his cuſtome to boaſt of his heinous crimes amongſt his companions. When <hi>Lydwin</hi> perceived ſhe was enforced to hear a Narrative conſiſting of ſo many wicked ſentences; ſhe demanded of him, whether he would give her leave, as an interpreter, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt them to a Prieſt? to whom he ſmileing ſaid: I do give you leave, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that I be not compelled to turn cryer and blazon out theſe my excellent vertues. <hi>Lydwine</hi> deſirous to help the poor man, carryed on the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with much diſcretion; and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grief of heart did pennance for the ſins related to her, as if they had been her own. Afterwards the man came to ſee her, and ſaid: I conceive you have made my confeſſion for me to the Prieſt, what pennance do you now enjoyn me? No more but this, replyed the Saint, you ſhall lye one whole night upright on your bed, without once turning on any ſide: perform this; and leave the reſt to me. Hereat the man laughed for joy: And do you command me nothing elſe, quoth he? is this all the ſubſtance of my pennance?

In the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was ſcarcely well laid in bed, when he began to be ſenſible of his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it ſeemed hard to him not to have the liberty to turn himſelf on either ſide; whence he thought his bed was never ſo uneaſiy; but when he reflected, he was forbidden to ſtir himſelf, this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upright became moſt irkſome to him. While he lay in this poſture, his buſy thoughts burſt forth into theſe words: Behold I am ſound and well in health, I lye alſo upon a ſoft bed; only I want freedome to turn me hither and thither as I uſed to do. But what need I care for that? ſleep, ſleep till fair day in the morning, ſleep ſecurely while ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is good. Fain would he ſleep, but cannot; ſuch an Army of different thoughts muſter themſelves before his fancy. What doſt thou want, ſaid he to himſelf? thou haſt but one night to ſpend thus in quiet, and then thou haſt fulfilled thy promiſe. Well: but what if thou wert conſtrained to paſs three or four nights in this manner? I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye. Wouldſt thou ſo? certainly I could never have beleived ſo great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſo ſmall a matter. But wretch

What if thou hadſt over and beſides to afflict thee, the Colick, Gout, Stone, or Head-ake? ſuch pains as theſe have ſome reſemblance of Hell. And to what place I pray thee doſt thou belong? queſtionleſs to that, whither ſo many horrid offences will uſher thee in the end: Thou haſt been bold a thouſand times to commit hainous faults, for which long ſince thou deſerved Hell. What kind of beds do they lodge on there, what covering have they, what ſheets? have they no other torment, but that they cannot turn themſelves on either ſide? what Feathers keep them warm? have they not flames inſtead of feathers? And how many moneths, how many years ſhall their torments continue? for ever, (if we give credit to the Goſpel) ſo it is indeed, for ever. What without end? aſſuredly without all end. What? after a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand millions of years ſhall their pains find no end, nor any hope of an end?

Well then, henceforward I will either be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, or no man. What he ſaid, he ratified indeed: O what a change did he make in a ſhort time!

                  <p>THis ſame paſſage, I beſeech you, let us take a view of with attention. To lye upon a bed of Down alwaies, to lye upon it for eternity, would be a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly unexplicable: what then will all that dreadful maſs of torments be in Hell?</p>
                  <p>One ſick of a burning Feaver is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo inflamed with thirſt, as he is perſwaded a whole hogſhead of Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water will not ſuffice to quench it. Good Lord! who will aſſwage the thirſt of the damned? they ſhall burn and thirſt, but neither all the Rivers in the world, not all fountains, nor all ſeas ſhall be of force
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29880:116"/>to appeaſe their ſcorching drought; therefore they ſhall not have one ſole drop.</p>
                  <p>O my God! how much doth the heat in Summer moleſt us? how we languiſh, how we faint, how we pant for breath! we throw off our garments, our bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths are caſt a ſide, we rowl up and down as impatient of heat; our bed ſcalds us, and nothing affords us a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhment. But O! what is this to that ſtove of brimſtone for eternity, where no mitigation is, not may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for? no cooler evening, no refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night, nor dewy morning appeaſes their ardours. They have night, tis true; but tis a fiery night, tis a night reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with dolours, tis a night everlaſting. Ah! let pains at leaſt terrify us, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be not ſtrong enough to invite us. The eternity of the damned is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unexplicable.</p>
                  <p>What ever is in Hell, is torment: which way ſoever they turn themſelves, they are environed with dolours. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them is Paradiſe, but ſhut from them eternally: below them is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe, never to be unlockt again: before them is the eternity of all their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: behind them is the moſt pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:29880:117"/>remembrance of pleaſures paſt: on their right hand they have the Devils to torture them: on their left are their companions in miſery: within them is anguiſh, the worm of conſcience, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Do we Chriſtians beleive theſe things and live as we do?
<note place="margin">Eſay. ch. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Who hath beleived our hearing? and the arm of our Lord to whom is it revealed?</hi> We are perſwaded theſe things ought to be beleived, but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive them very coldly. Our beleif hath ſcarcely any ſoul; it is not lively; as if I ſhould point at a painted table with my finger, and ſay: this is <hi>Abraham</hi> ready to ſacrifice his ſon; <hi>Abraham,</hi> I ſay not living but painted. Such for all the world is our faith, not lively, not breathing forth heat, not animated, but drawn with a Pencil. We beleive and beleive not.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I lay down here a brief method of meditating every day upon eternity.</p>
                  <p>A certain Father having Wealth in aboundance, provided his daughters of a handſome ſettlement: they perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the old man, he would be pleaſed to beſtow upon them in his life time, what means he intended for them at his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:29880:117"/>death: promiſing withal, their Father ſhould be plentifully furniſht with all neceſſaries. For the firſt year they made good their promiſe, and treated him with much liberallity: but when it fell out that he lived longer then they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they grew weary of the old man, and unmindful both of Piety and their Promiſe, they began to deal more nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly and harſhly with him. He to find a remedy for his folly by a wile, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a great Cheſt filled with Sand and Stones, to be ſecretly conveyed into his Chamber. This he opened in the night, and with that ſmall ſtock, which he had reſerved, he held on counting money ſo long, till at length it amounted to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſumm, which he purpoſely expreſt in ſuch a voice, as his ſon in Law might eaſily over hear him: Afterwards he lockt up his wealthy Coffer. Next morning his Daughters ſpoke more lightſomly to him, and demanded why it was ſo late laſt night ere he went to reſt? To whom the Father made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; My Children, when I judged all was ſilent, and none could take notice of what I did, I took a view of my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yet remaining: which of you two deſerves better of me while I live, ſhall
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:29880:118"/>enjoy it after my death. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a ſtrong emulation, both of them ſtriving which ſhould manifeſt greater reſpect to their Father. After the old man was dead they opened the Cheſt, wherein they found beſides Sand and Stones a Staffe, with this Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<q>
                        <l>Avarice brought the children to,</l>
                        <l>What Piety could not make them do.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much after this maner, though out of a ſuperior motive, may we fill our Cheſt with Sand, or little Seeds; that what Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety could not perſwade us to, Eternity may. Thus then we muſt go to work: Let every one fill his Coffer, Trunk or Desk; or what elſe is neareſt at hand, as his Purſe, Hat, Cup, or Gloves with Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, little Stones, Peaſe, or any other ſmall Grain, and when he is to meditate on Eternity he may begin to reckon in this ſort, that every Poppy ſeed, little Stone, or Peaſe may ſtand for a hundred or a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>For example one Grain ſignifies a thouſand years; two grains, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; ten, ten thouſand; a hundred, a hundred thouſand, a thouſand, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand years, and ſo of the reſt.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:29880:118"/>This is the firſt point belonging to our Method.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is: Although you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract ten or a hundred grains from thoſe in your Coffer, Hat, Diſh or other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, almoſt nothing will appear to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted or taken away. Mean while tis moſt certain, Eternity remains entire; though ſo many thouſand years paſs, as you caſt into your Cheſt Poppy ſeeds, Peaſe, or other grain. This is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true: For all this number hath its end, albeit you fill a moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious houſe with little ſeeds, and every one ſtand for a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>The third: When during Eternity, ſo many thouſand years are gone, as there be ſmall grains in your Coffer, yet eternity is whole, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not ſo much as the leaſt parcel of it is impaired. Nay, though that ſame Coffer be three, four, five times empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every grain ſignifie a thouſand years; nevertheleſs nothing is taken off from Eternity, it continuing durable, and of as vaſt extent, as when it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
                  <p>The fourth: This ſame thought, if ſerious and attentive, will ſomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the mind, yet muſt we not therefore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:29880:119"/>leave it off, but muſt go on forward. He that meditates may rouſe himſelf up in this manner: Go too in Gods name, lets proceed yet farther.</p>
                  <p>The fifth: By this kind of meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul will by little and little grow warm, and break forth into theſe or the like expreſſions: What do we mean? the traſh and toyes of this life we eagerly perſue, and look not after E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Tis too true, we buſy not out mind with years eternal.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth: Our underſtanding muſt be ſo by degrees informed, that it may frame a conceit of thoſe hidden ſecrets from what we perceive by our eyes. The Philoſophers Maxime is true: Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding muſt take inſtruction from our Phanſy.</p>
                  <p>Now as we may not with one ſtep mount to the top of a Ladder, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and as we cannot all at once fill a ſtreit neckt bottle with Wine; ſo it is not poſſible by a ſleight and ſuddain thought of eternity to imprint it either in the underſtanding, or will. By degrees we are to proceed from leſs to more. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as we fill a Hat, Cap or Cheſt, and by every ſeed we take out, we reckon a thouſand years; ſo likewiſe when a great
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:29880:119"/>room is filled, we muſt order our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh is to make a Colloquie to ones ſelf: What is all affliction in this world, compared to infinite milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of years, through and after which eternity ſhall endure, and that without any moving towards an end, or being in the leaſt impaired? Here every one is conſtrained to acknowledge: Although what ever calamity the world contains fell upon me alone, yet what would this be to pains eternal? Again: though I alone enjoyed all pleaſures the world can afford, and that for an hundred years together, what would this be to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of bliſs? What then do I, fool that I am, that I do not take another courſe? From this time forward at leaſt I will learn more wit.</p>
                  <p>If it chance that any one be oppreſt with pain in body, ſickneſs, or grief of mind; then chiefly is the time to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this thought: If this pain or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs were to continue ten, twenty, an hundred thouſand years; O God! how unexplicable would it be? But what would this be in compariſon of thoſe moſt ſharp pangs of eternity, which after Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ages know no end, but remain entire?</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:29880:120"/>
                  <p>Lo here a brief method to meditate on Eternity.</p>

                  <p>IT is moſt true, which one returning from the other world declared: No one beleives, how ſharp are the torments in Hell: No one underſtands their length; no one ſufficiently weighs their eternity.</p>
                  <p>Out alas! we are too much taken up with trifles, in which we are often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled till death; we now and then wrangle for we know not what, and as a Jeſt, or a Dream think upon eternity: whence it comes to paſs, that we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or ſleightly correct our miſdeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
                  <p>I, who write theſe things, as well as others who have written on eternity, do openly make this Proclamation: <hi>We have cured</hi> Babylon.
<note place="margin">Jeremy ch. 51.</note> It was in its free choice whether it would be cured or no. The way is ſtreit, the gate is narrow, and few enter in thereat. Many are called, and few are choſen. Therefore <hi>Hieremy</hi> the Prophet cryes out with a loud voice:

                     <hi>Let every one ſave his life.</hi> If he cannot do it otherwiſe, let him condemn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29880:120"/>to perpetual impriſonment, and bury himſelf alive. Tis better to paſs out of Priſon to Heaven, then out of a Palace to Hell.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Philoſophers had notice of this truth: <hi>Seneca</hi> exclaims; <hi>I was well pleaſed with inquiring after the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of Souls yea and I did beleive it too.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. 101.</note> Behold how they pondered the Myſtery of eternity, who were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the rayes of truth: What are Chriſtians obliedged to do? The ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpoke wiſely, when he ſaid: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt evils our beſt comfort is, they will have an end.</hi> The end is a lenetive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all miſery.</p>
                  <p>You may meet with one, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails the burning of his houſe: another who complains he has no friend, no one to aſſiſt him, none that cares for him. This man is afflicted through pains of body: that grows penſive becauſe he is in deſolation of ſpirit: One deplores his needineſs and want, another deems it worſe then death, to ſee himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. To what purpoſe, I pray, are theſe lamentations? The beſt remedy in miſery is, it will have an end: this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy eternity is deſtiture of: It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all kind of puniſhments, but is
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29880:121"/>wholly void of any end of them: Hence the eternity of the damned is a torment unexplicable.

                     <hi>Venerable Bede</hi> faithfully rehearſeth a remarkable paſſage, which hapned in his time. In the County of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> lived a man of great piety called <hi>Drithelm;</hi> who through extremity of ſickneſs was brought to the gates of death, ſo as in the beginning of the night he ſeemed to be dead indeed, and as ſuch lay all the night following. Next morning, being unexpectedly reſtored to himſelf; he ſaid, to the amazement of thoſe preſent, he was permitted to live yet longer, but after a farr different manner, then hitherto he had done. Wherefore he addicted himſelf to ſpend more time in Prayer; he diſtributed all his Goods amongſt his Wife, Children, and the poor; that done he renounced all worldly cares, and betook himſelf to great auſterity; which gave ſufficient teſtimony, what horrible things he had been eye-witneſs of in the other world. What he had ſeen, he did not promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly relate to all, but only to ſuch, as he knew were unfeigned friends of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Amongſt theſe was King <hi>Alfride,</hi> a man of eminent Learning, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

Theſe particulars compared with the delights of Paradiſe <hi>Drithelm</hi> much inſiſted on.

And that all might perceive he was in good earneſt, he uſed often, for the mortifying his fleſh to go into the River, which ran by his Cell, ſometimes to the middle, ſometimes to the neck, and ſtay therein ſo long till the Ice in Winter froſe about his body: at his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29880:122"/>comeing out he did not dry his clothes by the Fire, or Sun, but kept them on wet as they were, to the greater vexation of his body: in ſo much as he ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be apparelled with Ice then Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<note place="margin">See wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>S.

But one that contemplates eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will ſay: I have ſeen ſharper tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then theſe. <hi>Serapion</hi> had all his bones broken: <hi>Nicephorus</hi> Martyr after broyling on a Gridiron, was cut piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal. Yet ſtill one may affirm: I have ſeen more cruel uſage. <hi>Ianas</hi> Martyr not without bitter taunts had his fingers cut off, as if they were to be ſowen to ſpring up again; his skin was pulled over his ears, his tongue pluckt out, himſelf
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29880:122"/>was thrown into boyling Pitch, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all his Limbs were bruiſed upon an Engine. His companion <hi>Barachiſius</hi> was ſcourged with Thorns, had his fleſh miſerably rent, and in fine had all his bones torn a ſunder and broken. But I have beheld more bitter paſſages. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turninus</hi> being tyed to a wild Bull, whom they made more wild with prickling, was hurried through rough and craggy waies, and ſo drawn in peices: a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torment no doubt. Nevertheleſs I have ſeen more horrible. <hi>Martina,</hi> a Noble Virgin, being faſtned to four ſtakes, was beaten with ſtaves and ſtripes, was torn with hooks, caſt to the Beaſts, and condemned to the fire. <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meramus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> after his fingers were chopt off, his eyes pulled out, his ears and noſtrils divided from his head, his hands and feet were cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and his tongue out of his mouth. <hi>Leodegarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auſton</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> when he had undergone Famine and long Impriſonment, was deprived of his Eyes, had the ſoles of his Feet wounded and ſeperated from his body, his Lips cut away, and his tongue pluckt out. Yet worſe pains then theſe I have beheld. <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> endured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29880:123"/>ſtabs: <hi>Caſſianus</hi> a School maſter was run through with the Bodkins and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knives of his Schollars; whoſe hands by how much the weaker, ſo much more grievous was his Martyrdome. <hi>Mark,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> being pricked with Lancets on all ſides, was anointed with Honey, put into a wisket of Ruſhes, and ſo expoſed as a Prey to Bees, Waſps and Gnats. Notwithſtanding I have ſeen more harſh dealing then this. Bleſſed <hi>Maximus</hi> after he had bin rent with Hooks and had ſuffered the Rack, and bin beaten with clubs, was ſtoned to death. <hi>Anthimus</hi> Martyr, was tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with hot glowing Aulls, broken pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheards, fiery ſhooes, and ſtretched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Rack. <hi>Zoe,</hi> wife to <hi>Exuperius</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, after ſix daies Famine endured in a dark Dungeon, was hung up by the hair of her head, and ſtifled with ſmoak of burnt Excrements. <hi>Glycerius</hi> haveing been beaten till his bones appeared, was caſt into the fire. <hi>Peter</hi> the Exorciſt, companion to <hi>Marcelliuus</hi> Martyr, firſt was torn with whips, then had Vinegar and Salt poured into his gaping wounds, and laſtly was roaſted with a flow fire. <hi>Chriſtiana</hi> Virgin, was likewiſe roaſted and baſted with Oyl; Serpents were let
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29880:123"/>looſe againſt her; her tongue was pluckt out, and ſhot to death with Arrows. <hi>Maxima</hi> and <hi>Donatilla</hi> were cruelly beaten with rods, then had their wounds rubbed with quick Lime, and finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broyled on a Gridiron, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the beaſts. <hi>Theonilla</hi> had the top of her head taken off with a Raſour, which was afterwards Crowned with Thorns and Brambles; then being tyed to four ſtakes ſhe was barbarouſly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with thongs of Lether, and had hot Coales thrown upon her belly; amongſt which torments ſhe gave up the Ghoſt. Horrible pains were theſe no doubt, and ſharp ſufferings: Albeit I have ſeen ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and more horrible. <hi>Pantaleon</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been for a long time burned, was at laſt thrown into a Cauldron of molten Lead. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iuliana,</hi> Brother and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, were tortured on the Rack, were afflicted with boyling Pitch, beaten with rods of hot iron, ſeated in Chaires, and caſt upon beds ſtrook full of Nails, and after three dayes abode amongſt Snakes were for the Faith of Chriſt conſumed with fire. Bleſſed St. <hi>Barbara</hi> was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly rotmented with burning Torches, ſtripes, and iron hooks, and having her breaſts cut off, ſuffered her head to be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:29880:124"/>barbarouſly ſmitten with Hammers. <hi>Auxentius</hi> had his feet bored through with iron, and then being hanged upon a Wheel, was ſo long pierced with hot auls, till he ended his Martyrdome. <hi>Quintinus,</hi> of the illuſtrious order of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours in <hi>Rome,</hi> underwent mervailous torments; for after he had been dreſſed with boyling Oyle, Pitch and Fat, his ſides were ſcorched with burning Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, all his body was beaten with Chains: Muſtard, Lime and Vinagre were poured into his mouth (O ſtrange kind of drink!) and himſelf was thruſt through with two Iron Spits, from the Neck to the Thighes, having beſides ſharp needles ſtrook into all his fingers between the Fleſh and Nails. Do theſe ſeem great extremities of cruelty? But far greater are to be found in Hell, and thoſe eternal; in compariſon whereof the former may be reputed as a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game or a jeſt. We have ſeen far ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pains then all before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Even this Age we live in hath been witty in inventions of Tyranny. In ſome places the bellies of men conſecrated to God, being ripped open and ſtuffed with Provend, have ſerved as Mangers for Horſes, or troughs for Hogs to feed in.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:29880:124"/>Quick Mice have likewiſe bin placed upon mens naked bellies, and covered there under Baſons, on the tops where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a fire being made, the little creatures were compelled to ſeek for their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which finding no other way, they eate into the bowels of liveing men. Hence <hi>Caligula,</hi> thou maiſt learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to imitate. In other places mens bodies were cut aſunder joynt by joynt; burning Torches were put under their Armpits, and applyed to their whole breaſts; Hooks were thruſt into their entrals; and that they might be longer tortured before death, fires were kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led under them. Some have been cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in Bears-skins, and ſo baited by Maſtive Dogs, till they were devoured. Some again have been rowled on ſharp ſtones; ſome have been covered with a board, and preſſed under a thouſand pound weight, and ſo bruiſed to peices; with ſo much more cruelty and pain, by how much their death was ſlower. Theſe are cruel, moſt cruel ſufferings, yet who ever looks upon the pains of Hell with the eye of contemplation, will conſtantly pronounce of all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Martyrs together: I have ſeen much more cruel, I have beheld much
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29880:125"/>more dreaful. All the inventions of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty found out by Tyrants, are ſmall, are nothing at all in reſpect of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell; which are eternal, alas! alas! they are eternal.</p>

                     <note place="margin">ch. 21. ver. 5.</note> Where this Sword is once unſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, it will never be put up again, it is irrevokable. For the better underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereof, let us I pray betake our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves to a quiet poſture, as he did in Mount <hi>Choreb,</hi> who did contemplate E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity with much attention. Let us ſit down, and caſt up our accounts on Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or on our fingers ends in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Damned ſhall be tormented in Hell a thouſand years: that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Two thouſand years: nor that. Three thouſand years: that is too little. Four thouſand years: and that too. Five thouſand years: that is not ſufficient. Ten thouſand years: neither will that ſuffice. Twenty thouſand years: that falls ſhort of their due. Fifty thouſand
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29880:125"/>years: ſo likewiſe does that. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand years: this compared to eternity is nothing it will not do the deed.</p>
                  <p>To what ſumme would our compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation amount, it we ſhould go on recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning half a daies ſpace, as we reckoned before? What book of accounts would contain that ſumme? By midday he that Calculated would be overwhelmed with his own work: in fine, he would be conſtrained to ſay; the meaſure of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is not to be taken by the fingers; it cannot be reckoned, it cannot be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up by any numbers what ever; it is altogether numberleſs. Joyn what numbers you pleaſe together, let your product riſe to what height you will; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity goes beyond it: how farr? Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; it ſurpaſſes all computation, and hides its end in that endleſs revolution of Ages.</p>
                  <p>Ah, Mortals! ah Chriſtians! ah! how little do we conſider theſe things? how ſeldome do we leiſurely caſt up our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in this manner? Indeed no one beleives, no one beleives, no one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives. Theſe things I muſt tell you, are not dreams, they are no Fables, nor Rhetorical flouriſhes; here are no am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:29880:126"/>no exaggarations at all.
<note place="margin">Matt. c. 25.</note> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth has uttered the Oracle: <hi>Depart from me accurſed into fire everlaſting.</hi> The Sun is not clearer then theſe words, which makes me repeat: No one beleives, no one beleives, no one beleives.</p>
                  <p>In our firſt part of Eternity, we lead the Reader on by the hand to a right conſideration of Eternity. Here now imagine a thouſand Cubes, a thouſand Millions of years. Theſe are ſoon ſaid, but not ſo ſoon conſidered with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They make thus many years, 1000 000000000000000,000,000,000,000: or a thouſand, thouſand, thouſand, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, thouſand, thouſand, thouſand, thouſand times a thouſand thouſand years. After then ſo many thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are paſſed in Hell, as it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they will once be paſt; then each ones Conſcience of the Damned will ſay to them: Eternity is not yet begun, do not therefore look for any end of it, which never will be: Eternity remains yet entire: it is nothing at all leſſened. And after again and again and again ſo many more Centuries of years are come and gone, we muſt ſtill ſay the ſame: Eternity is not one jot diminiſht. It is yet as durable as ever; it cannot be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:29880:126"/>nor impared; but ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for immenſe revolutions of ages, and for ever beyond thoſe.</p>

               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 5.</head>
                  <p>TO conclude this I affirm: If any thing would, Eternity ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered would drive a man off his witts. But God requires not men ſhould go mad, but that they ſhould amend their lives. Give me a man, I beſeech you, that ruminates attentively the unexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable windings of Eternity; and I will likewiſe produce another, who ſhall be moſt ready to paſs over fifty, yea a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years in moſt rigorous auſterity of life. But in regard we meet with few ſuch, who handle ſharply their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who to appeaſe God give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hardſhip, and languiſh after Heaven alone; hence that is moſt true: no one believes, no one believes, no one believes. I will give the Reader a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account hereafter, why theſe words are ſo often repeated.</p>
                  <p>One would eaſily imagine the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for eternity well conſidered might prevail ſo far with us, as to make us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear what we know is diſpleaſing to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:29880:127"/>Hitherto as <hi>Eſay</hi> complains, <hi>Our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have made a ſeparation betwixt us, and God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſay. 59</note> Now therefore let us approch to him, and he will draw near to us.</p>
                  <p>For a Concluſion I add ſomething, which conduces to the explication of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. Imagine there is but one Sea in the whole world, (as many Learned men are of opinion) and that this Sea doth neither increaſe nor diminiſh; as certainly it will after the day of judgement. Let God now grant this ſpecial favour and grace, (give us leave to fancy it ſo) that an Angel be ſent to the Captives of Eternity with theſe joyful tidings: Be of good cheer, for I declare unto you great joy, though it will be long ere you be pertakers of it. God hath commanded that every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred year I ſhall come down to the Sea, and carry thence one drop of water: and when the Sea is drop by drop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt, your torments ſhall have an end; and you ſhall be removed hence to the ſociety of the bleſſed. This would be exceeding great comfort unto them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they were not to be releaſed till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter almoſt numberleſs revolutions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. We forſooth value not a benefit that comes ſo late, neither are we ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:29880:127"/>of ſuch an end; but rather conceive that promiſe will never take effect. For how many drops I pray are in the Ocean? who will ſumme them up? according to our capacity they cannot be numbred, nor the pains of hell brought to an end. But without all queſtion, the Damned would be very capable of this favour: they know well all that is finite is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within certain limits, the bounds of all things, but eternity may be eaſily found out; even the Sea it ſelf, though by drops only, may at length be emptied. Whereupon they would liſten to that promiſe of the Angel, as to moſt joyful news. But this comfort they are wholly debarred of: Such a welcome meſſage will never arrive at Hell: No ſuch thing may ever be hoped for. So vaſt an extent of time, tis true, will paſs away; wherein the Ocean by drops might be drawn dry: yet after all that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention of time the damned burn, and ſhall burn: No end may here be met with here is no period, bound, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, all things are eternal:
<note place="margin">Ezechi. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>That all fleſh may know, that I the Lord have drawn my Sword out of his Scabbard not to be revoked.</hi> The eternity of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is an unexplicable torment. Hence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:29880:128"/>even the dead bewailing our blindneſs cry out: No one beſeives, no one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives,

Intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stench, ariſing from ſo many ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carcaſſes, from a Sea of Brimſtone, and the Society of ſo many Devils. All the ſtink in this world ſeems to breath Cinamond and Balſome, if compared to that in Hell. It was often foretold them:
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:29880:130"/>you muſt expect to be bathed in ſorrow, if you hold on this courſe. But they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the deaf ear to theſe admonitions: they kept on their way, which lead them into a Bath, out of which they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go. How tollerable would it be to be tormented with this ſtench ſo many years, as minutes have paſſed ſince the world began to this hour? But alas! this ſtench will afflict them without end, for all eternity.</p>
                  <p>What is the fifth torment of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Moſt dreadful fire; to which our flames appear no more, then meerly painted. That goes beyond expreſſion, that their fire is unquenchable; ſince no Rivers, no Seas, no Deluge is of force to extinguiſh it; which Eternity it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put out. The Judge gave warning aforehand, the decree is confirmed, and intelligeable enough: <hi>Go into fire everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi> They ſhall be burned but not conſumed for all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>What is the ſixth? The worm of Conſcience: So much the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous torment, by how much it is farther extended. That this matter may be pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to the eye, we need imagine no more, then a fiery Cat ſticking faſt to each ones boſome, and ſcratching and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:29880:131"/>tearing it with her claws, in ſuch ſort, as though it be torn in pieces, yet it grows together again, that it may be torn anew for all eternity.</p>
                  <p>What the ſeventh? the place, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed company. Theſe were the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rements of ſin, which might have bin avoyded, but were not; now inſtead of dainties, they are buried in a Tomb of Flames: and in lieu of the ſociety of their deareſt friends, they are faſt chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the moſt execrable company of Devils and damned men: This place they muſt inhabit for ever, this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſtick to them for eternity.</p>
                  <p>What do you call the Eight Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Rageing Deſpair: which every moment murthers that impious crue, but yet it kills them not: as if a Knife or Dagger were continually ſtabbed to the heart for all eternity.</p>
                  <p>What now is the Ninth? Alas! alas! alas! unexplicable, immenſe, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Eternity: This of all torments is the greateſt. To ſuffer Darkneſs, Weeping, Famine, Stink, Fire, the worm of Conſcience, Deſpair, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with Devils; for one, two, ten, an hundred thouſand years, or for ſo many thouſand, as a skilful accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:29880:131"/>could expreſs in a ſheet of Paper; would amount to a number ſo great, as no Arithmeticians tongue could declare it: Nevertheleſs it would be finite, and upon this ſcore moſt welcome to the damned, becauſe at laſt after almoſt numberleſs Millions of years their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would have an end.</p>
                  <p>But the ſentence is pronounced, and cannot be recalled. Their torments muſt be endured without end: yea, as the Prophet has it, <hi>For perpetual Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is it, which can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared, no nor conceived, or underſtood. Eternity cauſes in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous dayly ſighing; it is to the wicked a fearful dream; and to the Damned an unexplicable torment. Here now adjoyn we three concluſions.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 2.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt Concluſion: All the world eſteems pretious is deſpicable, and a mere ſhadow compared to Eternity. If all Silver, Gold and coſtly Gemmes were amaſſed together in two Balls; all Enſigns of Honour, all glory of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs; all <hi>Salomons</hi> and <hi>Sardanaphalus</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:29880:132"/>his delights, all allurements of pleaſure, all ſweetneſs of Voluptuouſneſs were joyned in one, they would be of no more value then a contemptible Muſhrum, baſe traſh, or an empty ſhadow; or, to ſpeak more cloſely to the point, all aforeſaid in reſpect of eternity is but like a bare reſemblance of a fly. Who would care for that Feaſt, which after one or two morſels haſtily ſwallowed, muſt be relinquiſht? Who would extol that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which paſſes through the Panch? ſuch are the treaſures of this life; vile Morſels, Crums, Vanity, Nothing.</p>
                  <p>Excellently well to the purpoſe ſpoke St. Auſtin:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.</note> 
                     <hi>It doth not ſuffice us, what ever is long in time, if it have an end, and therefore deſerves not the name of long. If we will be covetous, let us covet eternal life.</hi> All beſides this which we have amongſt us, is but Nutſhels, mere Bables. Hence proceeded thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phi. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I eſteem all things to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment for the paſſing knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt: for whom I have made all things as detriment, and do eſteem them as Dung.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Concluſion: No Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man lives ſo ſpareingly, nor trears himſelf ſo roughly; no one is ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:29880:132"/>againſt his body as they would be, if they were freed from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other world. What we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a moſt ſevere life, is a life ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in pleaſure, if compared to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual neceſſity they have in Hell to live and dy for ever. We may be thought to ſleep moſt ſweetly, though we paſs over many nights awake: we though ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with calamities, flow in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; whereas they are tormented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and every hour dye a thouſand deaths.</p>
                  <p>An Authour worthy of credit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caeſari. Heiſterb.</hi> Lib. 2.</note> how <hi>Theodorick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Virecht</hi> had a Servant called <hi>Eberbach.</hi> This man was in good repute with his Maſter, as well for his great prudence, as faithful induſtry: yet could he not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the envy of others, which moved him in a frantick humour to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſlave to the Devil; hoping thereby to find ſome releif againſt his malicious oppoſers. After ſome years <hi>Eberbach</hi> dyed; and his Soul being ſeparated from the Body was thrown into a Pool of Flames: in which he was ſo tormented that after his return to this life again, he affirmed: If one great fire were made of all the Trees and Wood in the world,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:29880:133"/>he would rather fry in that till the day of judgement, then abide one hour in the former flames. He likewiſe gave a particular account of the cold, darkneſs and other pains in Hell. While he was there moſt ſharply tormented, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from Heaven ſpoke to him in this maner: Behold quoth he, this reward they deſerve, that ſerve the Devil. But tell me, if thou might go back to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, wouldſt thou take courſe to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate thy ſins committed? Whereunto he anſwered: I will refuſe no puniſhment, ſo I may go hence. In fine, upon this condition that he ſhould undergo vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pennance, he was reſtored to life; and in regard his body was not yet buried, he raiſing himſelf upon the Bier, put all the ſtanders by to flight. Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he began vigorouſly to do Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his faults, adhering to Biſhop <hi>Otho,</hi> who was going to the Holy War. Vnder whom he chaſtiſed himſelf ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, that he ran by his horſe barefoot, not careing how much he wounded his legs and feet with thorns and ſharp ſtones. Almoſt all the money he had, he diſtributed amongſt the poor: he faſted every day with bread and water, which he took moſt ſparingly. Some
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:29880:133"/>admiring this auſterity of life, perſwaded him to take a milder courſe: to whom he replied: you have no cauſe to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my ſtrickneſs; I have endured far worſe: were you there you would be of another mind. When this Holy travel was ended, he and his wife became Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, to ſpend the remnant of his dayes in expiating his crimes. Theſe things he related of himſelf to <hi>Iohn Xant,</hi> from whom the Authour had his intelligence.</p>
                  <p>Here we may fitly call to mind that wholſome admonition: I have ſuffered more grievous things. And you O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, muſt ſuffer more grievous things, unleſs you be content to undergo ſmaller croſſes here with patience. Sometimes we complain others do us wrong: here ſay to your ſelf, you ſhall endure more hereafter. Sometimes others fill your ears with complaints; tell them, they muſt paſs through greater difficulties: the like may be practiſed in all troubles and miſeries. Wherefore do you exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garate your grief through impatience? Except you be careful: greater affliction will befal you. All you ſuffer is nothing, if you look not upon thoſe bloody Bathes of New, but thoſe fiery Gulfs of <hi>Pluto.</hi>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:29880:134"/>Therefore leſt you be conſtrained to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure more, ſatisfy your ſelf with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going leſs.</p>

                  <head>SECT. 3.</head>
                  <p>THe third Concluſion: All labour, which tends not to Eternity, is not only vain, but for the moſt part hurtful. Concerning which matter Chriſt delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf moſt expreſly:
<note place="margin">Matt. c. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>What doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and ſuſtain the damage of his ſoul.</hi> It is not only bootleſs for us to ſeek after Riches, Health, and Pleaſure; but even in vain do we ſtrive to compaſs the whole world, if in perſuit thereof we loſe our ſelves. Make uſe of, and enjoy Riches, Health and Pleaſures, in as great height as your heart can deſire; when that is paſt, you have purchaſed no more then Smoak and Shadows; if after this life you be faſtned to a ſtake incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with fire. Contemplate I pray, in what maner ſome uſe here to torment others, by driveing a ſtake through their bodies, till it come out at their mouths. A dreadful Spectacle no doubt. The miſerable wretches hang tyed in this ſort; and ſometimes to the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:29880:134"/>of their pains are roaſted with a ſlow fire, as well as chained and nailed to a poſt hands and feet. Alas! how doleful is their ſuffering? eſpecially, if it were to continue a hundred thouſand years, if for all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Alas! What doth it profit a man,
<note place="margin">Lucas Bergen.</note> if he gain the whole world, and ſuſtain the damage of his ſoul? We do in ſome meaſure underſtand this Oracle; but as a learned Divine ſaid; moſt men have a miſt caſt before their eyes by the fleſh. Hence St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> made this true aſſertion: <hi>Albeit that fire rage,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 55. ad pop.</note> 
                     <hi>that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be all on flames; yet we laugh, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ſports, and ſin freely.</hi> What ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may I more fitly repeat, then that of the Prophet? <hi>Let every one ſave his life?</hi> Eternity comes a pace towards us, and we poſt towards eternity: ere long we ſhall meet together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ioſophat</hi> being inſtructed by <hi>Barlaam</hi> in the principles of Chriſtian Religion,
<note place="margin">Damaſ. Hiſt. de Barl. &amp;c</note> ſaw as it were in a Dream, a Viſion of Hell, with the different kinds of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in that place; and with all heard a Voyce that ſaid: This is the manſion of the wicked, who have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the puddle of Vices. After the viſion was over, he fell into a ſtrange
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:29880:135"/>trembling, and tears trickled down his Cheeks amain, wherewith all allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unchaſt pleaſure quite vaniſht away; whence <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> became wholly another man.</p>
                  <p>Good God! how obdurately malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are we? Hell is not repreſented to us in a Dream, but by an unerrable faith: and yet what a life do we lead? We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are often changed, but ſtill to worſe: We alter our former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if we were weary of it, and take upon us a new habit of impiety farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the former. Whereupon every one may make this prayer with St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard: Have pitty on me O my God, before I be tormented eternally in Hell.</hi> Nay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wicked man may pray, as <hi>Manaſſes did: Do not deſtroy me together with mine iniquities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Paral. ch. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>neither be angry with me for ever, reſerving evil for me; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me unto thoſe loweſt places under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground: Becauſe thou art the God of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners.</hi> What expreſſions, O my God, may I, who am liker a Beaſt, then a man, rather make uſe of then theſe? <hi>Spare me, pardon me, have mercy on me; do not remember mine iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Chriſt our Lord the day after <hi>Palm-Sunday</hi> went from <hi>Bethania</hi> to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:29880:135"/>
                     <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he ſtept aſide to a Fig tree to gather ſome fruit to appeaſe his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but finding none, he ſaid:
<note place="margin">Matt. 21</note> 
                     <hi>Never grow there fruit of thee for ever. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent the Figtree was withered.</hi> Such as theſe are all the inhabitants of Hell, accurſed Figtrees, alwaies barren, pluckt up by the roots, and caſt into the fire to burn for ever: they will never bring forth fruite for eternity.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Behemoths</hi> Kingdome there is no knowledge of patience at all, nor of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: no vertue is to be found there, the Soyl is altogether fruitleſs, no trees are to be found there, but ſuch as ſprung up for fuel: they will bring forth no fruit for ever.</p>
                  <p>After our firſt Parents had taſted of the forbidden Apple, they were quickly baniſht from that Garden of Pleaſure, and an Angel in Arms placed to guard the entrance thereof: this is atteſted by Holy Writ: <hi>And he caſt out Adam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and placed before the Paradiſe of Pleaſure Cherubims, and a flaming and a turning ſword.</hi> This was a moſt ſignal teſtimony of Divine mercy, there to place a ſervant only, and not the Lord of Paradiſe with a ſword to hinder all entrance. It will not be ſo in the day of Judgement,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:29880:136"/>when no ſervant ſhall be permitted to have a ſword: Our Lord will take the ſword himſelf, and draw it againſt the damned:

               </head>
               <p>VVEll ſaid an Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher: The begining of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the knowledge of ſin. He will
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:29880:136"/>never ſin grievouſly, who with attention ruminates the gravity and uglineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Take ſin out of the world, and you take away all evil together with it. Sin is the onely evil in the world, yea the very nurſery of all other evils, a moſt profound ſea of all miſeries, and a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs depth of torments. Hence iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> Sin is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling madneſs, a voluntary Devil. This moved the Mother of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> while he was young, to inſtill this principle into his heart: My ſon, I would rather thou ſhouldſt dye, then ſin mortally. well to our purpoſe ſpoke <hi>Iohn Climacus:</hi> Though we ſhould faſt a thouſand years continually with Bread and Water; though we ſhould bring the whole world to mourn with us; though we ſhould equal the River <hi>Iordan</hi> by weeping drop by drop, yet could we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfy for our faults committed.</p>
               <p>This made the Wiſe man cry out:
<note place="margin">Ecc. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>As from the face of a Serpent, flee from ſins.</hi> Who touches the cup wherein Death has Vomited, to ſpeak with <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and in which Poyſon is offered to the taſter? There is nothing in the world more formidable then ſin: Upon which ſubject much hath been delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:29880:137"/>as well by word of mouth as writing: whereunto we will annex five aſſertions. who ever ſins mortally:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Offends God moſt grievouſly, and makes him his adverſary and foe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He loſeth all Gods Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He becomes guilty of all miſeries and calamities.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He loſeth Heaven for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He throws himſelf headlong into everlaſting pains in Hell.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> comprehends the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in a word: <hi>The wages of ſin is death;</hi> and all the train of death, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, pain, ſickneſs, anguiſh, which are Harbingers, are followed by eternal death. All this, tis meet we ſhould conſider more exactly, therefore we will proceed with our aſſertions in order.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 1.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt is: Whoever ſins mortally, offends good grievouſly, and makes him his adverſary and foe. By ſin the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream God is wronged, ſo far, as man places his final end in the creature with neglect of the Creatour, This is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream injury, and not much unlike to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry:
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:29880:137"/>for which cauſe, ſins in Holy Writ are frequently called Idolatry. Such temerity as this is found in all grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſin, and is worthy of all puniſhment whatever. For in regard God is moſt preſent every where, the ſin is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before his eyes, who ſo much abhors it; and ſo becomes an injury to God, who is both Spectatour and hearer: Thus we affront the Soveraign King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face. Yea, and what is worſe, we abuſe benefits to the diſpleaſure of our Benefactour: For that very help, which God affords us in every action, we turn againſt him: As if a Father ſhould provide his little Son of a Dagger, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he might learn to defend himſelf; and withal ſhould guide his childs ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arm: yet the wicked Boy ſhould ſtrive to murther his father, even while he held up the hand ready to ſtab him. This is every ones caſe that ſins: While God both helps and directs his actions, theſe he moſt injuriouſly converts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Now for better manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this notorious affront take a view of what enſues.</p>
                  <p>So often as a man is about to ſin, he ſtands betwixt God and the Devil, as judge and umpire, whether he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:29880:138"/>for. God explicates his own Law, and withal ſhewes his Crucified Son, to withdraw man from ſin. The Devil ſets before him pleaſure, the bait to all evil, hereby to perſwade and entice him to ſin: Whoever now ſins, declares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe for the Devil; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe turning away from God, he moſt unjuſtly adjudges the cauſe to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. What elſe is this, but to ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? Let Laws command, or prohibit what they will; let Gods Son Crucified admoniſh, crave, move, or manifeſt what he pleaſe; let God himſelf menace what he liſt from Heaven; the Devil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me ſo ſweetly, he drinks to me in ſuch a ſugred cup, that he perſwades, he gets the victory, I go, I run after the Devil, I permit my ſelf to be drawn by him: This Inkeeper gives me content, what ſhot ſoever he demand. This is exactly the proceeding of every one that ſins grievouſly.</p>
                  <p>Thus God is put into one ſcale, and Pleaſure into the other: man comes to weigh them, and when he is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſin, he reſolves rather to loſe the friendſhip of God, then debar himſelf of pleaſure: and ſo prefers <hi>Barabbas</hi> the Theif and Murtherer, before Chriſt our Redeemer.</p>

                  <p>What more baſe, horrible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſo Soveraign a Majeſty, then for a creature to deal thus with its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour? <hi>Be aſtonied O Heavens upon this,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jeremy ch. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and O Gates thereof be ye deſolate excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ſaith our Lord. For two evils hath my people done; Me they have forſaken the Fountain of living water,</hi> a moſt clear fountain, and have thirſted after muddy water.</p>
                  <p>Yet for further Declaration of this particular: Man as we ſaid, is drawn two waies; this way God draws, that the Devil. It is freely in mans choice, whom he will follow. The Devil ties man in a thread, (for he can do no more) and propoſes to him ſomething which may either ſooth the fleſh or ſtuffe the purſe, or puff him up with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: with theſe threds he draws man, whom he has entangled, whither he pleaſes. Now that man may ſatisfy his Luſt, or encreaſe his Fortune, or be ſeated on the Throne of Honour, he tramples underfoot the expreſs Law of God.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe God binds man with cords not eaſily broken: He ſets before his eyes his numberleſs benefits, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from him due ſervice, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to baniſh him from Heaven, and
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:29880:139"/>throw him into Hell for ever, if he be diſobedient. But all in vain, what ever God either promiſes, or menaces: The Devil bears the Bell, and through mans wilfulneſs is obeyed before God: Man deeming it more for his purpoſe, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the enticements of Satan, then the commands of our Saviour: wherefore he reſolutely breaks a ſunder all Bands which God hath impoſed upon him.</p>
                  <p>Tell me now all you that wittingly run into ſin, and conſtitute the Devil your Commander; tell me what Hells, what Eternities may ſufficiently expiate this injury done to God?</p>
                  <p>Heretofore God bitterly complained of this proceeding:

                     <hi>Thou haſt burſt my bonds, and thou ſaidſt: I will not ſerve.</hi> This complaint is ſutable to the matter: for this in reallity every one doth, who is reſolved to ſin; he burſts his Bonds and ſaies; I will not ſerve. Hence may Satan inſult or upbraid even Chriſt our Lord: Behold how thou art treated by thine own; thus men whom thou haſt created, love thee, thus they honour thee for whom thou haſt dyed; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom thou beſtoweſt thy ſelf with all thou haſt. They know well what they may expect from me, and yet they run
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:29880:139"/>after me; they ſuffer themſelves to be inveighled with a momentary pleaſure; I have them ready to ſerve me at a beck; they are not ignorant that I am their ſworn enemy, and for all that they love me, though I do but fobb them with vain hope of a ſmall gain, Luſt, or a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Honour. Take notice, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe march under my ſtanderd. I was not buffeted for them, as thou was, Chriſt, for thine; I was not ſcourged, nor carried a Croſs, nor died on it as thou didſt Chriſt for thine. Beſides I do not promiſe them Heaven, nor offer them Paradiſe; as thou doſt, Chriſt to thine, whom thou inſtructedſt with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, teacheſt with examples, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieſt with threats, and guideſt with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. But all this is bootleſs: they turn the deaf ear to thee, and willingly hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my ſuggeſtions. They chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fry in Flames eternally, then for a moment to live in ſubjection to thy Lawes. No wrong is done to them that are willing; they ſhall periſh, becauſe they will periſh: becauſe they abandon their Creatour, they ſhall have me for their Lord and Maſter, to tyrannize o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
                  <p>What have we to ſay to theſe things,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:29880:140"/>my bretheren, ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian?</hi> Do you not by this time palpably perceive, O Mortals! how great an affront this is to God? This then is that, which neither Hell fire nor eternity can ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate. We buſy our ſelves now and then with enquiring; Why God puniſheth one deadly ſin, which is committed in a moment, with flames eternal? Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral anſwers are given to this queſtion by Divines, amongſt which ſcarce any one is ſatisfactory: Touching this point we ſhall enlarge our ſelves in the enſuing Chapter. However, he that would take pains to conſider maturely, what we have already diſcourſed; would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I doubt not, that every heinous crime muſt needs be infinitely diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God; and that the injury, which by ſin redounds to his Soveraign Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, is ſo unexplicable, that it can never by any torments be compleatly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The matter is apparent: By how much the perſon offended is more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſublime, ſo much more grievous is the offence. He that injures one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to himſelf, is blame worthy; but much more is he that being a Profane perſon, is injurious to one in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:29880:140"/>whether Prieſt, Biſhop, Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or Cardinal; and more yet, if the party affronted be King, or Emperour, but moſt of all (in the judgement of men) if he offer violence to the Popes Holineſs: thus the fault increaſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as perſons wronged, are of a higher rank. Hence in regard God, who is vilified, is of infinite Majeſty; the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is guilty of infinite malice.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the more clear knowledge one hath of the Deity, the more exactly he perceives and execrates the malice of ſin. Certainly God hath ſo much hatred for ſin, that an eminent Divine of St. <hi>Dominicks</hi> Order pronounced this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>It is moſt certain, that if all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtandings were joyned in one, and all tongues were combined together, neither that underſtanding, nor this combination of tongues were able to comprehend, or declare the hatred God bears towards ſin.</hi>

                     <hi>For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is infinitely good, he hath infinite love for goodneſs, and infinite hatred for malice.</hi> Whence it happens, that the reward of that, and the puniſhment of this is everlaſting.

                  </p>
                  <p>For the deeper impreſſion of the great
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:29880:141"/>hatred God hath againſt ſin, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if you pleaſe, what penalty a juſt Judge has often inflicted upon one crime. The mind is manifeſt by its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and Gods hatred is declared by the execution of his juſtice. What pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment I pray is that of the Angels? <hi>Lucifer</hi> a ſtupendious Prodegy of all beauty and comlineſs, was with many millions of Angels thrown down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into thoſe flameing gulfs. What wickedneſs trow you, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived? One proud thought was their offence. Alas! O God! alas! muſt ſuch a multitude of Potentates, (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of one whereof a thouſand Kings are of ſmall account) be for ever dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? And have they no reſpit allowed for mercy, pennance, or the recovery of Grace? ſhall not all eternity be of force to wipe away the guilt of one proud thought? may not infinite ages ſatisfy for one ſole crime, which was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a moment? With good reaſon might God ſay to the Rebellious Angel and his aſſociates: I could quite deſtroy and annihilate you, but you ſhall remain to my Majeſty, to the bleſſed Angels, and all mankind, a Prodigious wonder, a ſpectacle of wickedneſs, a mark of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:29880:141"/>juſtice, and an eternal abyſſe of my fury towards you.</p>
                  <p>If any one were ſpectatour while the Sons of a thouſand Kings and Emperours were beheaded, he would ſigh and ſay: This Royal Progeny muſt needs be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome execrable deſign, that makes them all without mercy thus generally loſe their heads; it is wonderfull above meaſure that no place is left neither for interceſſion, number, birth, nor cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to plead for their delivery. The very ſame we may here think, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire ſo many Millions of Angels are thrown into eternal flames, without any hope of pardon, mercy or favour; and that no regard ſhould be had of their nature and Celeſtial Origin, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great numbers; nor the extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their fault, but that altogether ſhould be involved as it were in the ſame whirlwind, all condemned of High Treaſon, and adjudged to everlaſting death.</p>
                  <p>Ah! my God, ah! how unſpeakable is the malice of ſin, that ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the implacable wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and ſo implacable, as not to be mitigated with any revolution of ages, or any torments whatever? Hence all
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:29880:142"/>hope of pardon is exil'd: Theſe Rebels to God, ſhall be baniſht Heaven for all eternity. The time of grace is paſt, no liberty may be expected: all interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is bootleſs, all Petitioning is in vain. The whole buſineſs is concluded, the decree is ſetled without revocation. Heretofore they were beautiful Angels, now they are ugly Devils; heretofore they were friends of God, now as his ſworn enemies they ſhall be tormented with fire everlaſting. And what offence brought them to this ſad Cataſtrophe? we told you even now: One proud thought. O King of Nations! who will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here now let no one deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and imagin the ſin of the Angels was of a far different rank from thoſe of men. We may behold the like example in our firſt Parents, as in the Angels. Who together with their poſterity were deprived of Gods grace, robbed of the garment of innocency, ſhut out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, whence they were perpetually ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, and heard this fatal ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them: <hi>You muſt dye.</hi> Neither was it ſufficient for them to dye once, they were lyable to eternal death, which now began to domineer
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29880:142"/>over immenſe multitudes of people; yea even over all mankind, had not the Son of God taken pitty of us, and become man to dye upon the Croſs for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. We had all bin loſt, but that he vouchſafed to dye, who was immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: for Original ſin had already infected the whole maſs of mankind. What now I pray was that horrible offence of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?</hi> He taſted of the forbidden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Alas! Was the only biteing of an Apple to be chaſtiſed with ſo many Tears, ſo many Funerals, ſo many Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? But wherefore do we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? This is the nature of ſin: it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diſpleaſing to God, it is puniſhed with infinite pains, and in concluſion is never expiated. God is wrath, when he is angry at ſin.</p>
                  <p>Take yet a nearer view of the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mankind. The whole world ſerved as a Tomb, to bury all men in, by a deluge of waters; ſcarce eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being preſerved alive from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation. What was the cauſe of ſuch prodigious mortality? Who tumbled into the angry waves ſo many hundred thouſand men? Sin, and eſpecially that of Luſt, Who conſumed with fire thoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:29880:143"/>ſtrately Cities of <hi>Gomorrah, Sodom,</hi> and the reſt? Sin, and chiefly Luſt. Who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the City of the <hi>Sichimites?</hi> Sin, and particularly that of Luſt. Who ſlew five and twenty thouſand Benjamites, and forty thouſand Iſraelites in Battail? Sin, and principally that of Luſt. Thus God proceeds, thus he vents his ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſin; in this point he knows not how to diſſemble. No ſin eſcapes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment: for though many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon, yet none goes free from chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p>What puniſhment is that of <hi>Heli</hi> the Prieſt for his careleſneſs in correcting his Children? what of <hi>Saul</hi> for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? Of <hi>David</hi> for incontinence? Of <hi>Nabuchod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When a Medicine is prepared of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Gold, Pearls, or Bezoar ſtone, one may reaſonably affirm the Diſeaſe is dangerous, and life deſperate: So we muſt needs acknowledge the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin was exceſſive, which could not be taken away, but by the blood of Chriſt, which is of infinite value. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge therefore O man</hi> (ſaith St. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard) <hi>how grievous are thoſe wounds, for whoſe cure it was neceſſary Chriſt our Lord ſhould be wounded.</hi>

                  <p>OUr ſecond aſſertion is: <hi>He loſeth all Gods grace, that ſins mortally.</hi> Any one mortal ſin robs the Soul of all Divine grace. There is nothing more amiable then a Soul adorned with Gods grace; nothing more ugly then a Soul without it, though it be defiled but with one deadly ſin. Sin is a moſt venemous Serpent, whoſe ſting is mortal, how ever his Poyſon ſeem to enter with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. O that we might behold with our eyes the deformity of ſin, we ſhould fly as faſt from it, as we now purſue it! ſin is more terrible and deformed, then the Devil. <hi>Lucifer</hi> a Prince amongſt Angels ſurpaſſed the reſt in comelineſs, but all his beauty was ſo defaced with one ſin, that now he is moſt ugly, ſtinking and dreadful to behold: his ſole aſpect, as many affirm, is able to bereave the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour of his life.</p>
                  <p>Divine grace is of ſuch value, that one may juſtly pronounce, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more pretious in all the world. I declare my ſelf. It may be affirmed of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:29880:145"/>liquid Gold, or of the water of life, that one drop of either is more eſteemable then a hundred veſſels of the choyceſt Wine. This ſame may be patly applyed to Divine Grace: the leaſt degree of it is far more pretious then all the favour of men, or all the worlds wealth beſides. Imagine the World were all refined Gold it were of no value in compariſon of Divine Grace. Yet one mortal ſin hath ſuch oppoſition with it, that when ſin is committed, it leaves not one ſole dram of grace in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>What merit ſoever hath been colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for many years, one ſole ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes in a moment. This is aſſerted by <hi>Eccleſiaſtes:</hi>

                     <hi>He that ſhall offend in one point, ſhall loſe many good things.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one had made himſelf acceptable to God by the practiſe of all kinds of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for fifty, for an hundred years ſpace; if any one had lead a ſtrict life, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted every day with bread and water; if any one had girt his loins with an Iron Chain, whipped himſelf dayly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all he had in Almes; and after all this, ſhould commit one mortal ſin; he would loſe all the merits of his life paſt, all the Grace of God, and of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Friend, become a profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God.</p>

                     <hi>If the juſt man ſhall turn away himſelf from his juſtice, and do iniquity, all his juſtices which he had done, ſhall not be remembred.</hi> Haſt thou committed one ſole mortal ſin? all thy former labours are loſt, all grace is loſt; thou haſt loſt Heaven, God and all.

                     <hi>Woe to them, when I ſhall depart from them.</hi> This departure of God from the Soul is the death of it. An incomparable evil, an evil that ſurpaſſeth all the ſufferings of Holy Martyrs, yea the everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the damned. Take a view. I pray, of the miſery of man deſerted by God for ſin: what ever ſuch a man doth, what ever he ſuffereth, while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Divine Grace, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountains, leap into the fire; pluck the Stars from Heaven, ſet whole Fountains on fire, and act wonders to be admired in all ages, yet ſhall he not merit the leaſt degree of Heavenly bliſs,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:29880:146"/>while he continues in Gods disfavour. The reaſon of what I affirm is manifeſt: The Origen of all merit is divine grace; therefore let him either purchaſe grace, or deſpair of Heaven. I adjoyn another point altogether as deplorable.</p>
                  <p>He that hath forſaken God, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, might indeed throw himſelf down at his pleaſure, but all the ſtrength he hath cannot riſe again: He caſt himſelf into a ditch, out of which he can never eſcape, unleſs God by his ſingular favour lend him his hand. An Echo returns no anſwer, but when provokeed by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious noyſe: and he who has ſinned, doth not true pennance, except he be firſt excited by God.

                  <p>Seeing therefore the nature of ſin is ſo cruel,

                  <p>Hereupon likewiſe the ſame Author diſcourſes in this manner: <q>Open thine eyes, miſerable Soul, and ſee what formerly thou haſt bin, and what now thou art: what was thy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then, and what now. Thou waſt an Eſpouſe of the Higheſt, a Temple of the living God, a Veſſel of Election, a Bride-chamber for an eternal King, a Throne of the true <hi>Salomon,</hi> a ſeat of Wiſdome, a Siſter of Angels, an Heir of Heaven. All theſe prerogatives thou didſt enjoy; but now with tears lament thy ſuddain change. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe of God is become an Adultreſs of the Devil, the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt is turned into a Den of Theives, the Veſſel of Election into one of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the Bride-Chamber of Chriſt, into a puddle for Beaſts to wallow in; the feat of Wiſdome into a chair of Peſtilence, the Siſter of Angels into a companion of Devils; yea ſhe, who ere while like a Doveſoared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:29880:147"/>the Heavens, now like a Serpent creeps upon the earth. Bewail there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bewail O wretched Soul, thy doleful ſtate; for the Heavens mourn for thee, the Angels and all Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore thy condition, the tears of <hi>Paul,</hi> and bloody ſtreams iſſuing from the body of Chriſt our Lord condole with thee, becauſe thou haſt ſinned, and haſt not done pennance for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to a fuller examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point: He who hath ſinned is either ſepſible his Conſcience is wounded, or he is not ſenſible: If he be ſenſible, he is alſo miſerable, becauſe he groans under moſt piercing grief; a guilty conſcience is an exceſſive tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if he have no feeling of his inward wounds, then he is miſerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure: it is the worſt of evils to cheriſh ones own wickedneſs without perceiveing it, and to have loſt all ſenſe after one is mortally wounded. Thus Drunkards while they are Carouſing, perceive not the ſtrength of wine, which when digeſted they are ſenſible of. Well ſaid St. <hi>Chryſoſtome: The chiefeſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is to be wicked.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Serm. 5. de jeju.</note> Albeit the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doth not ſcarify a ſick perſon, yet
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:29880:147"/>doth his ſickneſs ſtill remain with him: and although God doth not puniſh the offender, nevertheleſs he that offends is diſeaſed, yea already dead.</p>
                  <p>Not unlike to this is that aſſertion of <hi>Seneca: The prime and greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinners is, to have ſinned. Neither is any crime without pain, becauſe the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wickedneſs is in wickedneſs it ſelf. The Conſcience is ſcourged with what ever is done amiſs. Where Vice is, there is alſo puniſhment: Neither can a goared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be without grief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though no one ſtrike a wicked man, though no one maim or torture him with rack or flames; yet he himſelf is his own Executioner. Peradventure he is inſenſible, and hath loſt all feeling of his ſad condition: He is therefore ſo much nearer to Hell fire by how much he is farther off from the knowledge of his own offences. Such an one may be rightly termed dead and buried: Who hath ſinned and is not ſorry; who hath grievouſly tranſgreſſed, and ſues not for pardon; who hath loſt Gods grace and ſighs not for it; who is deprived of his right to Heaven, and eſteems it no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; who is ready to be tumbled into Hell, and laughs at it. What a bruite
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:29880:148"/>is this? what a ſtone? what a block? this is the malignant nature of ſin, ſo to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form men into beaſts, ſtocks and ſtones, as that they perceive not their own ſcars, till they be diſcovered by hell fire.</p>
                  <p>We then begin to abhor ſin, when it is attended by rigorous chaſtiſement. Yea it often comes to paſs, that ſuch as through impiety have loſt all feeling, receive a foretaſt of hell before they part with this life. So thoſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> had a tryal of Hell,
<note place="margin">Hom. 4. Epiſt. ad Rom.</note> before they came thither. Patly ſpoke St. <hi>Chryſoſtome: When mention is made of Hell, if thou want faith and ſcoff at it, call to mind the burning of</hi> Sodom. <hi>For we have beheld, we have beheld, I ſay, even in this life a repreſentation of Hell, in that conflagration of</hi> Sodom, <hi>as they can teſtify, who have travelled to thoſe places, and bin eye witneſſes of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation thundred down from Heaven. Imagine how grievous that offence was, which brought hell upon them, ere they went down into Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wonderful and almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects of the Plague and Lightning, who is of ſufficient ability to declare? and yet much more exceeding all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is that Plague and Lightning of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:29880:148"/>ſin, which conſumes and layes all waſt. Sin of all evils is the greateſt and only evil: it is worſe then Death, then Hell, then any puniſhment, becauſe it is the ſource from whence all puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>

Nevertheleſs ſhe ſtands to what ſhe ſaid: <hi>If I ſhall do this it is death to me.</hi> The chaſt Matron knew well there was another death, beſides that of the body, a perpetual an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death,
<note place="margin">James 1.</note> in compariſon whereof bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death deſerves not the name of death. That of the Apoſtle is moſt certain: <hi>Sin when it is conſummate, ingendreth death.</hi>

                  <p>Moſt truly ſaid St.
<note place="margin">Hom. 5. ad pop.</note> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome: The ſeveral names of calamities are bare names to them that diſcourſe aright, that alone is calamity indeed to offend God.</hi> He hath too mean a conceit of God, who dares prefer before him any Lucre, or baſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Were there ſome other deity as amiable, rich, liberal and holy, which we valued more then God, our folly
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:29880:149"/>might have ſome colour of excuſe; but ſince we eſteem moſt vile traſh, and ſet more by a few drops, then the whole O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean; and put an higher price on crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then the Creatour of them; is not this down right madneſs, manifeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, the worſt of evils, the ſeminary of all calamities?</p>
                  <p>But what dare not fool-hardy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals attempt? Even Fables themſelves diſcover unto us mans temerity. Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants have a deſign againſt Heaven, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> invades Hell, <hi>Jaſon</hi> with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes dives into the Bowels of the Sea, <hi>Daedalus</hi> takes his flight through the air. This Leſſon we learn from Fictions: The proud like Gyants aſſail Heaven, which is expoſed only as a conqueſt for humility: Such as deſpiſe God, make hell but a buſineſs of langhter: covetous perſons <hi>Iaſon</hi> like, hoyſe Sails in purſuit of the Golden Fleece: Ambitious men, as <hi>Daedalus</hi> did his wings, open their jaws to every breath of vain glory. Bold mortals ſtoutly undertake any enterprize which leads them by the hand to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>And whence, I pray, proceeds Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Strife, War and utter ruine, but from ſin alone? All the health, comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:29880:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſtrength which is in mans body, by means of ſin becomes a prey to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and to death. This made the Royal Prophet exclaim:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ealth in my fleſh, my bones have no peace at the face of my ſins.</hi> This likewiſe moved our Heavenly Phyſitian to arm us againſt all Maladies with this wholeſome docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now ſin no more, leaſt ſome thing worſe happen to thee. Peſtilence and all ſorts of diſeaſes made their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the world by the Portal of ſin. Turn over the Hiſtory of Kings, and you ſhall manifeſtly obſerve, Pride brought them under the laſh; read <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> and you may find Rapine chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well as Luxury by the Prophet <hi>Ioels</hi> teſtimony. No place wants exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of divine juſtice: What miſery did ſin involve the Kings of Iſrael in, what the Corites, Sodomites, <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiran</hi> with multitudes of the Jewiſh race, and infinite others? How many hundred thouſands how many millions of men hath ſin bereaved of life by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Plague, Warr, Fire, Water, and other untimely means? <hi>They have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for their iniquity.</hi>

                     <hi>Becauſe they that are malignant, ſhall be caſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So unto all men death did paſs by ſin,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:29880:150"/>that life is no beter then a continual death. This truth receives light from the rehearſal of ſome of thoſe many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of death invented to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way life. Wherefore are Priſons in the world? wherefore have we ſtocks Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Shackles, Bolts, Halters, Racks, Scourges, Grid-irons, Wheels, Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Frying-pans, Iron-combs, Gallows and ſuch like proviſion? had not theſe a begining to revenge ſin committed, or were they not found out by ſuch as were reſolved to do amiſs by tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing over the innocent? I muſt needs acknowledge the Variety of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be great, but far greater is the diverſity of crimes which deſerve pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Proteus</hi> never put on ſo many ſeveral faces, nor <hi>Empedocles</hi> changes, nor <hi>Pythagoras</hi> traſmigrations, nor <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> varieties, nor <hi>Evantius</hi> ſhapes, as ſin doth different forms and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Now as honeſty and innocency of life elevate a man above the ordinary ſtrain, ſo lewdneſs and impiety caſt him down below the meaneſt of men, and rank him amongſt bruite beaſts. Is he worthy the name of a man, who for ravenouſneſs contends with the Wolf; who by anger
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:29880:151"/>reſembles the dog, by Pride, the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, by Avarice the Toad, by Levitv the Sparrow, by ſubtilty the Fox, by Greedineſs the Vulture, by Fury the Lion, by Fearfulneſs the Heart, by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiouſneſs the Goat?</p>
                  <p>Hence King <hi>David</hi> gave unto Snakes and Aſps the Epithete of angry, and of fooliſh to Mules; <hi>Hieremy</hi> termed Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Adulterers; <hi>Ezechiel</hi> called <hi>Pharao</hi> a Dragon; St. <hi>Iohn</hi> likened the Pharaſees to a brood of Vipers; Chriſt branded the ſhameleſs with the name of Dogs and Swine, as he did Herod with that of Fox. Sin changes men into beaſts; as is apparent out of Holy Writ:
<note place="margin">Pſa. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Man when he was in honour did not underſtand: he was compared to beaſts without underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and became like to them.</hi> This is no great change: Sin converts a man into a Devil, as Chriſt plainly ſaid to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſples:
<note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Of you one is a Devil.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected likewiſe unto the Jews: <hi>You are of your Father the Devil.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8.</note> Now the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil according to St. <hi>Anſelm,</hi> though war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by terrour and menaces, would not abſtain from ſin: neither would man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, albeit he was threatned with death if he did tranſgreſs. The Devil ſinned once, but man offends many
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:29880:151"/>ſand times: he rebelled againſt his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, whereas man impiouſly kicks both at his Creatour and Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>St.
<note place="margin">In cap. 9. Joan. hom. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> inveighs ſeverely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an envious perſon: <hi>An envious man is worſe then the Devil: the Devil indeed bears envy, but to men, not to his own companions: whereas thou being a man doſt envy men, and practiſe hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe of the ſame kind and nature with thy ſelf, which Satan doth not.</hi> A wicked man may rightly be ſtiled a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yea hell it ſelf:
<note place="margin">Apoc. c. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>And Hell and death</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>were caſt into the Pool of fire.</hi> How could this be? was hell caſt into hell? it was ſo, if we credit Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours upon this place: becauſe he who ſteers a wicked courſe, may juſtly be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Hell. For as hell is a place of torments, and an abode for Devils; ſo a man of debaucht carriage ſuffers the pangs of a guilty Conſcience; wherein the Devil hath taken up his quarters. Thus then this Hell ſhall be caſt into Hell.</p>
                  <p>O ſin, O blaſting and peſtiferous whirlwind! which killeſt in the budd both bloſſoms, leaves and fruit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions: which depriveſt man of juſtice and innocency, and robbeſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:29880:152"/>him of himſelf. O Poyſon, which doſt murther when beloved, and infecteſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the very Marrow of the Soul; and canſt not be aſſwaged by an Ocean of calamities, nor extinguiſhed by the flames of Hell!</p>
                  <p>God makes this queſtion to our firſt Parent after his fall:
<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Adam where art thou? Adam</hi> might with reaſon have returned this anſwer: I am no where. He was then no where indeed: For by ſin committed he was ſeparated from God; and puniſhment for his fault exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him from Paradiſe: Neither was he in himſelf, by reaſon of the remorſe his Conſcience endured; neither was he in other creatures, which his offence had moved to Rebellion; nor in the world, becauſe of his own inconſtancy. He was then no where, alas! he was no where, where he might find repoſe: But he was like unto a ſwift running torrent, whoſe ſtreams in regard of their rapid motion can neither be affirmed to be here, nor there.</p>
                  <p>Do you deſire to know what ſin is? Take a leiſurely view of <hi>Adams</hi> fall. How many millions of men were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the depth of miſeries by it? from it ſprung Famine, War and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:29880:152"/>from it all Calamities, Diſaſters, yea death it ſelf. Such a tree might well bring forth ſuch fruits; from ſuch a cauſe ſuch effects were eaſily produced. True it is, the Son of God was faſtned to a Croſs to expiate this crime; and yet how many millions ſuffer wrack in hell through ſin? Who ever will attentively conſider theſe things, when ſoothing pleaſure invites him to offend, may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay: I will not buy eternal repentance at ſo dear a rate.</p>
                  <p>When the Heavens frown and burſt forth into ſtorms of Hail, Snow, Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds, Thunder and Lightning; the cauſe is, that Exhalations and Vapours, through their native lightneſs are eaſily drawn up, and afterwards in various tempeſts fall down to the earth again. No otherwiſe deſcend from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us violent ſtorms of Dearth, Warr, Plague, Sickneſs and other miſeries; which God indeed rains down amongſt us, but after the Exhalations and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of our tranſgreſſions had aſcended on high: that lecture we learn from the Schools of Phyloſophy, this of Divinity. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks to the purpoſe: <hi>The evil we ſuffer, our ſins have deſerved.</hi> The ſame is atteſted by <hi>Eccleſiaſticus:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:29880:153"/>Death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">ch. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>Bloud, Contention and Sword, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, Famine, and Contrition, and Scourges: For the wicked all theſe were created.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sin Baniſht us from Paradiſe into this vale of tears, into this tempeſtuous Sea, where boyſterous Winds, and lofty Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges cauſe frequent Ship-wracks, and all other miſeries. <hi>Sin maketh people miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 14.</note> How came the Turks ſo often to infeſt Chriſtendome? Whence proceeded ſo many inroads of Barbarous Nations? So many Victories obtained againſt us? What is the cauſe we are ſo much peſtered with Famine and Plague? Why doth that Face of Heaven toward us ſeem to be all of Braſs, and either drown us with too much wet, or make us pine away for want of Rain? Whence do Diſeaſes ruſh in upon us by whole ſwarms? All theſe are effects of ſin: ſin is an abiſs of all calamities.</p>
                  <p>I muſt needs deliver my mind in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca's</hi> words:
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 95</note> 
                     <hi>He is deceived that thinks God can have a will to do hurt: he cannot. God neither doth evil, nor hath evil: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he chaſtiſe ſome, and keep them in awe with puniſhments.</hi> His eyes are clean from ſeeing evil, and cannot look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:29880:153"/>iniquity: Therefore he bears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream hatred againſt ſin. Even as light of its own nature hath oppoſition with darkneſs, Comlineſs with Deformity, Goodneſs with Malice, Purity with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Life with Death: So hath ſanctity with all wickedneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God loves ſanctity beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in like manner his averſion from ſin is infinite. Marks of his averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are theſe that follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he withdraws himſelf and his grace from a ſinner. Then he puniſheth ſin with many calamities as with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent coyn, even in this life. Thirdly he takes from the Malefactour all right to Heaven: Therefore we muſt either do true pennance, or bid adieu to Heaven. Fourthly every mortal ſin he chaſtiſeth with flames eternal, and yet (which cannot be expreſt without admiration) the chaſtiſement is leſs then the ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. All Divines unanimouſly affirm, an everlaſting torment is decreed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mortal ſin, neither can it ever truly be ſaid: This ſin hath been puniſht ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently. What then is a mortal ſin? Alas! alas! Let all Angels anſwer this queſtion, which yet they are not able fully to declare, that which lurks under
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:29880:154"/>one deadly ſin is infinitely abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Ludovicus Bloſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to ſtir up deteſtation of mortal ſin is exceeding dreadful:
<note place="margin">Monil. ſpur. c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Mother of our Lord, the moſt Bleſſed Virgin, had ſinned mortally, and had dyed without contrition, ſhe had never attained Heaven, but must have been tormented with the Devils in Hell. So rigorous is Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This likewiſe was revealed to St.

                     <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi> who heard the Devils cry out to the ſupream Judge in this manner: If that thing which thou loveſt above all things, which is the Virgin that bore thee, and which did never ſin; if I ſay, ſhe had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mortally, and had dyed without due contrition, thou art ſuch a friend of Juſtice, that her ſoul could never have arrived in Heaven, but muſt have been with us adjudged to hell.</p>

                  <p>St. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> gives this prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: <hi>Brethren, be not children in your understanding, but as to malice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come little ones; for it is a childiſh fear to fear death, as children do who are afraid of Vizards, and not of fire to which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their hand: after the ſame manner we ſtand in fear of death, which is but a contemptible bug-bear, and fear not ſin, which indeed ought to be feared.</hi> Becauſe it robs us of all Gods grace; makes us ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all ſorts of miſeries, and guilty of eternal Flames. Thus much concerning our third aſſertion.</p>

                  <p>THe fourth aſſertion is: <hi>Who ever ſins mortally, loſeth Heaven for all Eternity.</hi> Sin ſhuts againſt us the gate of Heaven, the Empyrial Heaven, which is adorned with all delight, which is for ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation moſt ſublime, for extent moſt ample, and in every reſpect moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, in a word the worlds wonder: from this heaven doth only deadly ſin debar us.

                     <hi>Giles,</hi> one of St. <hi>Francis</hi> his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Catechiſing an ignorant perſon, ſaid: A certain man wanted Hands, Feet and Eyes; to whom one of his friends ſpoke in this manner: My friend if one ſhould reſtore thee both Hands, Feet and Eyes, what requital wouldſt thou make him? I would quoth he, become his ſervant all the dayes of my life. Well then replyed <hi>Giles,</hi> who gave thee Hands, Feet, Eyes, Tongue, Ears, Soul and Body, together with the good thou injoyeſt? God without doubt. If then thou wouldſt be his ſervant that only reſtored ſome few Limbs, what is it meet thou ſhouldſt do for God, who gave thee all? Tell me now what a baſe part it is to offend him with thine eyes, that beſtowed them on thee? or to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front God by word or deed, who framed both tongue and hands for thee?</p>
                  <p>Hence ariſeth in us an infinite obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſerve God; from which if we ſwerve by tranſgreſſion, both fault and puniſhment muſt needs be infinite. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (according to St.</hi> Bernard) <hi>what was ſhort in time or action, was certainly
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:29880:156"/>long in the ſetled reſolution of the will. Now as he is juſtly condemned that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſts in vice, ſo is he blame-worthy that ſtrives not to better himſelf in vertue.</hi> In like manner, he who dies in ſin, hath a living death in eternal pain; wherein he muſt abide for ever, that he may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer torment for ever, but never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>Alas! one merry moment of nimble winged time we prefer before treaſures of glory and delights eternal: we loſe a needle, and are ſorry for the loſs; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſnatcht from us, and we laugh at it. We know full well, that upon every greivous crime an happy, or wretched eternity depends: the privation of that, and poſſeſſion of this is due to every great offence. Thus much we know, and yet ſin boldly; eſpecially while we are not certain of one minute of life. For who I pray, after ſin committed, hath ſo much as one ſole moment ſure to do pennance in? Nevertheleſs in a buſineſs of huge conſequence, and ſuch extreme uncertainty, we expoſe our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal weal to manifeſt hazard of eternal wo: ſo freely do we exchange everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting glory for endleſs torments: and in effect, fools as we are, demonſtrate
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:29880:157"/>our hatred to Heaven: For Heaven he hates, who by contempt or careleſneſs intangles his ſoul with ſin.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> ſaies <hi>Plutarch,</hi> made a vow to throw himſelf headlong from the Summit of <hi>Lucas.</hi> But when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the dreadful height of the Rock, he was ſtrook with horrour, and altered his purpoſe. Afterwards being upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for want of courage, he anſwered: I did not imagine that for performance of my vow I needed a greater vow. Who ever deſigns to execute ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult exployt, muſt take upon him a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſutable to the exploit. But alas! what compariſon betwixt this precipe from a high Mountain, to caſting ones ſelf headlong from Heaven to Hell? How then do ſo many throw themſelves down from the fruition of bliſs, to thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome amongſt Devils? They ſhut their eyes ere they attempt to do ſo, they conſider not the infinite malice of ſin, nor the inexplicable windings of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: They jogg on towards Hell blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded. He that is not pleaſed with his own blindneſs, endeavours by all means poſſible to eſcape this downfal; and chooſes rather to undergo what ever happens, then to be caſt into that

                     <q>How great a puniſhment is it, only to be deprived of the ſight of God? Such as have not taſted of that ſweetneſs, if they do not deſire to ſee the face of God, let them at leaſt be afraid of fire; thoſe who are not invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with reward, may be terrified with torments. If what God promiſeth ſeem to thee of ſmall account, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at what he threatens. The ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his preſence is offered to thee, and thou art not changed, nor moved, nor ſigheſt after, nor deſireſt it. Thou ſtill huggeſt thine own ſins; and the delights of thy fleſh: Thou heapeſt to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:29880:158"/>thy ſelf ſtraw, and fire will come upon thee. Fire will burn in his ſight. That fire will not be like thine, into which notwithſtanding if thou wert compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thruſt thy hand, thou would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any thing then that. If he that compels thee ſhould ſay: Either ſign this wrighting againſt the life of thy Father, and Children, or thruſt thy hand into thy own fire; thou wouldſt obey him rather then burn thy hand, or any member of thy body, which could not abide in pain forever. Thy enemy therefore threatens a ſleight evil, and thou doſt evil; God threatens eternal evil, and wilt thou not do good?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What trouble ſoever the Devil cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in our ſouls, it is by means of ſin. Hence our paſſions rebel, and we are moleſted with fear, ſuſpicion, inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, grief, anxiety, deſpair; whereby mans ſoul is reduced by ſin to reſemble Hell.

                  <p>Such as abandon themſelves to ſin, are loaden with ſo many Chains by the Devil, till at length with their own weight they ſink down into hell. While they live they draw nearer to hell; as a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:29880:158"/>great ſtone tumbled from the top of a Mountain, tumbles ſo often, till in the end it lye in the bortome. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, while a notorious theif went up the Ladder, the Hangman encouraged him ſaying: You have but one ſtep further to go: and ſo he turned him off. In this manner little birds with others of the ſame feather fly again and again to take their food, till at laſt they are enſnared. In this manner Drunkards animate their pot-companions; this one cup and no more: This courſe they continue, till they drown each other in ſtrong liquor. And the like method is obſerved by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: In the beginning they think it much to commit one ſin; by and by they double, redouble and multiply of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, till they come to hundreds.</p>
                  <p>Thus he who at firſt ſinned privately and with much baſhfulneſs, by degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Out alas! What age ever brought forth ſuch a Monſter, that would not have its fury ſatisfied with one death? What Executioner, what Tyrant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented not their cruelty with Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors dying once, but after that would proceed to a ſecond death? One death hath been ſufficient to appeaſe moſt barbarous Tyranny. Whereas ſin, more cruel then any Monſter, or Tyrant, is not glutted with murthering man once, but murthers him eternally. When you behold an Offender hurried to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his fleſh pluckt off with hot Pincers; you forthwith imagine his crimes were hainous, ſince his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo exceſſive: How grievous then muſt that fault be, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be expiated with flames eternal?</p>
                  <p>This point is often treated, theſe pains are frequently denounced by God,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:29880:160"/>and yet we are backward in forbearing ſin. Theſe particulars we are aſſured of, and ſtill hold on to violate divine Laws with extreme temerity. This fault we know, deſerves to be eternally baniſht from Heaven, that crime makes its Actour puniſhable with fire everlaſting, both in ſoul and body; in ſo much, as ſin may ſeem to blow the Coals, and to ſubminiſter Fuel for the duration of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He that would ſeriouſly weigh what is here delivered, would he not bridle his unruly appetites? would he not reſtrain himſelf from ſin, and tread a better path? It is down right madneſs to chooſe rather to periſh, then amend ones life.</p>
                  <p>O Mortals conſider theſe things: this matter is exceeding ferious, and of mighty conſequence. Heaven is not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with doing nothing.</p>
                  <p>All this notwithſtanding men ſin with as much freedome and ſecurity, as if God were ignorant of their acting: they go on as boldly, as if God had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them; and offend as confidently as though God did nor look on while they offend. We admire the fooliſhneſs of <hi>Eſau,</hi> who valued a diſh of Pottage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his birth-right: Let us now admire
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:29880:161"/>no more all we that eſteem a bruitiſh pleaſure at a higher rate, then our title to the Kingdome of God; all we that ſell our Inheritance of Glory for an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty blaſt of humane praiſe. What is now become of thoſe Heroick reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I will rather loſe my life, then ſin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells you how <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> was reduced to that extremity by thirſt, that he gave himſelf and his Army up into the hands of his enemies; and after he had ſwallowed a cup of cold water, he cryed our; wo is me, baſe fellow that I am, that have parted with a Kingdome for ſo ſmall pleaſure! With how much more reaſon may one that ſins mortally exclaime: O wretch that I am, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of man, who for a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and beaſtly delight ſell my right to Heaven, prefer creatures before my Creatour, Vice before Vertue, Death before Life, and Perdition before Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
                  <p>Ah! covetous miſcreant, for how ſlender gain doſt thou ſell away Heaven? Alas! Lacivious beaſt, why doſt thou change eternal joyes for a moments pleaſure? O wrathful and envious man, how ſeldome doſt thou meditate on
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:29880:161"/>hell? And thou O Drunkard, why wilt thou quaff away an Ocean of Celeſtial Nectar? Good Lord! what height of folly is it, when a bleſſed eternity lyes at ſtake, to part with everlaſting happineſs for a minutes delight? Luſt, Revenge, Drunkenneſs, and all other vices pleaſe but for a moment, and merit torments for an entire eternity.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore do we now wonder, that God eternally puniſhes the wicked, ſince the reward of the vertuous is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end? Again, he that ſins mortally for a tranſitory pleaſure, ſells away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Devil; what marvail if the buyers title become perpetual?

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:29880:162"/>it has a devouring ſtomach, while competent matter is ſet before it, it feeds greedily, and by feeding grows bigger: it ſpares nothing that is fitly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for its pallate, it ſwallowes up Houſes, Cities and Kingdomes: it makes no diſtinction betwixt friends and foes, it layes all waſt, it conſumes all: it has inflamed whole towns, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive it will bring the world into confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration. What Jaws, what Panch may I ſay it hath, whoſe hunger ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of ſuſtenance is not able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage? We do not therefore wonder that by one ſpark entire Cities become deſolate, but that the flames were no ſooner extinguiſht.</p>
               <p>In like manner, we do not gain-ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one that affirms our life to be but a moment; and indeed compared to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it ſcarcely deſerves to be called a moment. Now if you ſay further, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity depends on this moment, I ſhall not contradict you, becauſe I know, an eternal reward is acquired with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pains; for in caſe the labour were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, the recompence could not be perpetual. Neither ſhall I conteſt with any who avoucheth, everlaſting joy may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:29880:163"/>ſince this bleſſing is not due to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts but to the merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This then is that which holds us in admiration; that eternal puniſhment is frequently incurred in a ſhort time, in a moments ſpace with one ſole thought. Actions vertuouſly performed deſerve an endleſs Crown, by reaſon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours merits, which are of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: But how our ſins ſhould be of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite malice, and conſequently merit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite pain, this paſſes our underſtanding, this argument of Divinity we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. For what malice I pray, lurks under the ſweetneſs of a filthy Luſt, in which one freely lingers for an hour, or part of an hour, or a minutes ſpace, which may not for all eternity be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expiated, even in flames eternal? This it is we mervail at, this altogether tranſcends our capacity.</p>
               <p>Something in anſwer to this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath formerly been alledged; yet in regard the matter is weighty, and hard to be underſtood, we ſhall enlarge our ſelves in the declaration of it, and unfold this Riddle, Why a ſin committed in a moment is puniſht with eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? where by the way we ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the efficient cauſe of this doleful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>

                  <p>IN Chriſtian Religion ſeveral myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are contained, which humane reaſon is not able to comprehend: Of this nature we particularize five.</p>
                  <p>The myſtery of the bleſſed Trinity; the Incarnation of Chriſt; the miracle of the Holy Euchariſt; the reſurrection of the dead, and eternity of torment. Now for as much as theſe points are hard to beleive, therefore Divine Providence hath in a ſingular maner confirmed them by Scriptures, Councils and Miracles. Our talk in this place is to diſcourſe of pains eternal, and why God, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to have mercy would have them eternal.</p>
                  <p>Divines in this point have gone diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes to anſwer the difficulty. Some ſay, the Damned alwaies ſin, therefore they are alwaies puniſhed. What injuſtice therefore is it for him to groan under pain, who perſevers in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injury?</p>
                  <p>This anſwer is not amiſs: For not only the damned ſin perpetually in Hell, but even here, while they lived amongſt us, they found out a certain kind of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:29880:164"/>to ſin in; which is the matter we are to weigh with maturity.</p>
                  <p>Who ever heaps ſin upon ſin till death, ſins during his eternity (let us call it ſo): Therefore in Gods eternity he is moſt juſtly puniſht. Both truly and elegantly ſaid St <hi>Gregory: It is manifeſt and certain beyond controul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. Dial. 44.</note> 
                     <hi>that neither the bleſſed have an end of their joyes, nor the damned of their ſufferings.</hi> It is an Oracle of truth: <hi>And they ſhall go into puniſhment everlaſting: but the juſt into life everlaſting.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 25</note> Since therefore Chriſt is true in his promiſes, he cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in his threats. If you demand, how can it be juſt to puniſh a fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, which had a ſpeedy end when it was a doing? The bleſſed Biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers: <q>This might well be objected, if the ſevere Judge weighed only deeds, and not the hearts of men: for the wicked therefore had an end in ſinning, becauſe they had an end in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; ſince they were reſolved, if it had been in their power, to have lived alwaies, that they might alwaies have ſinned. It is apparent, they deſire to live perpetually in ſin; who while they live, never give over ſinning. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appertains to the great juſtice
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:29880:164"/>of the judge, that they never want pain, who in this life would never be without fault.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I would by all means have this obſerved: This circumſtance goes along with ſin, <hi>Not only to have ſinned, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſire to ſin yet more:</hi> juſtly is this deſire puniſhed with hell: becauſe God doth not only look upon ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but likewiſe the eagerneſs and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to commit more: as will appear by this example.</p>
                  <p>Imagine a man of thirty years old is adjudged to hell, becauſe he did not leave off ſining: had he lived fifty, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeventy years, he had continued ſo long his ſinful courſe: Nay if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a hundred, a thouſand years, he had ſtill held on ſining: Yea, if his life had been without end, ſo likewiſe had been his ſins. Seeing then his deſire to ſin was ſo great, as to be even eternal in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, deſervedly is his puniſhment eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Therefore as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> inculcates; Let them never be without pain, who in this life would never be without fault.</p>

                  <p>MOreover the damned do not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate faults committed; they do not lay aſide that malice, which begun with them during life: for they have not ſo much grace of God as to repent. That which followes is moſt dreadful, and unexplicable: The damned are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of divine grace, that for eternity none of them will ever ſay: <hi>Have mercy on me O God:</hi> none of them ſhall ever have that grace. In which perticular they reſemble much the Devils, from whom no torments what ever ſhall be of force to ſqueez theſe words: <hi>We have ſinned ſpare us.</hi> Hence one may rightly affirm: In Hell are only Devils, that is, moſt obſtinate and deſperate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God; ſuch as are not the devils alone, but likewiſe all the damned.</p>
                  <p>And in this point the wicked man du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, and the damned in torments, are both a like; neither of them being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with their own forces to recal their ſoul from ſin. In this caſe help from God is neceſſary: which he never denies while we live, albeit we loſe his Grace a thouſand times: but withal he gives us
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:29880:165"/>this admonition; Look to thy ſelf, lo, now I pardon this fault, which I ſhall not alwaies do. I forewarn thee, and covenant with thee; while thy Soul is in the body, the gates of mercy ſtand open for thee; enter in: but ſo ſoon as the ſoul is gone out of the body, theſe gates ſhall be cloſe ſhut.</p>
                  <p>This proceeding of God is moſt juſt: For if the damned, while he lived, had asked pardon, ten, twenty, thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, he might have obtained it. But when death has once bereaved us of life, it is in vaine to hope for any more pardon, help or grace.</p>
                  <p>God made this agreement with us, and added a thouſand admonitions, that we ſhould not reject grace when it was offered, nor mercy while we might find it. But we reſolved to embrace neither, Grace is vaniſht, Mercy neglected, we had a mind to be miſerable, we were determined to periſh: Therefore if we periſh, we may thank our ſelves, we cut our own throats, and refuſed to be friends of God, and ſo by our own choice we never ſhall be.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, wicked actions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to good: to thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting pain is due, to theſe eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:29880:166"/>For according to that Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime of Phyloſophy, the ſame rule holds in contraries. The perfection of beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is to be happy without end: Then the accompliſhment of torments in Hell is to be miſerable for eternity. Chriſt cloſes all his divine Sermons with this ſentence:

                     <hi>who deſtroyed in himſelf that good, which might have been eternal.</hi> This is the very cauſe of everlaſting torment, the infinite malice of every mortal ſin.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:29880:166"/>For being an infinite goodneſs is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the offence diſcovers infinite malice which was bold to violate the ſupream Good with ſuch temerity.</p>
                  <p>Sr. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Prince of Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth, that <hi>Sin is nothing elſe but an ill humane act.</hi> To every mortal ſin he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes a twofold malice: The one, an act differing from the rule of reaſon: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an injury done to God, by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him. Now this malice is no other then a voluntary averſion from God, which deſerves infinite pain, becauſe it refuſeth an infinite good. Certainly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortal ſin carries with it a contempt of God, as will appear by this example.</p>
                  <p>There is a Law enacted under pain of death in a City of <hi>Italy:</hi> Let none wear Sword nor Daggar. He that knows this Law, and yet will carry Sword and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; either contemns the Magiſtrate, or the Prince who made it. God in like manner has publiſhed to the world: Let none Steal, none Lye, none commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs, what ever the Law ſay, this man Steals in the ſight of God, that Lyes, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Adultery. Is not this to contemn God? He that violates <hi>Caeſars</hi> edict, ſins againſt <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and he that deſpiſeth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:29880:167"/>Laws, deſpiſeth God. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of Holy Writ: <hi>The ſoul that ſhall ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lev. 6.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and contemning the Lord, ſhall deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Neighbour the thing delivered to his cuſtody.</hi> So in St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion: <hi>Sin is, contemning an unchangeable Good, to adhere to things ſubject to change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence comes to light that infinite malice of ſin: For by how much the Majeſty offended is greater, by ſo much is the offence more grievous. To affront a Noble man is grievous; to offer an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe to a Lord is more grievous; and more yet to injure an Earle: but much more a Prince, and moſt of all a King or Emperour. Theſe degrees are obſerved amongſt men to lay open the nature of injuries offered. What injury is it then to contemn God, who is a Law-giver of infinite Majeſty?</p>
                  <p>Whence it comes to paſs, that the infinite malice of one mortal ſin, though in an unclean thought only, wittingly conſented to, cannot be Cancelled by any humane actions what ever. For if into one Scale of Divine juſtice all the merits of the moſt glorious Virgin-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all other Bleſſed were caſt; and into the other ſide of the Ballance were put one only mortal ſin, this would
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:29880:167"/>outweigh them all, ſo as for this they would never be able to make due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. It is altogether dreadful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that all holy actions of all the juſt are counterpoyſed by one mortal ſin. This notwithſtanding he will ceaſe to admire, who knows how to frame a right eſtimate of God and his immenſe Majeſty. It is an unſpeakable temerity for a creature to contemn its Creatour. St. <hi>Mark</hi> teſtifies:
<note place="margin">ch. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall be guilty of an eternal ſin.</hi>

                  <p>SO great therefore, and infinite is the malice of one mortal ſin, that all acts of virtue joyned together cannot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance it, unleſs the Soveraign judge be pleaſed gratiouſly to pardon it. In which work Gods inexplicable libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity appears, who pardons one mans ſin a thouſand, and a thouſand times; but under this condition, that he ſin no more, or if he do, that he do true pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance before he dye: which the ſinner often times diſters and dyes indebted; whereby he is guilty of an eternal ſin.</p>
                  <p>Admirable to the purpoſe ſpeaks St <hi>Auſtin: When any one is put to death for
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:29880:168"/>ſome heinous crime, do the lawes eſteem that ſhort ſpace of his execution a ſufficient puniſhment, or rather his removeal for ever from the company of the living? For as the Lawes of this City cannot recal to life one that is killed: no more can he that is condemned to the ſecond death be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to eternal life.</hi> If a Magiſtrate take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from an offender a life, which he gave not; may not God with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do as much?</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore the malice of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin is infinite, it deſerves alſo infinite puniſhment: which foraſmuch as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inflicted by way of intenſion (as Schools teach) it is requiſite it be done by extenſion: that is, what ſharpneſs of torment was not able to do, let length of time recompence. <hi>He will give fire, and worms into their fleſh,</hi>

                     <hi>that they may be burnt, and may feel for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While we conſider theſe things, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks we ſhould be ſo diſpoſed, as they are, who being guilty of frequent rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, cannot behold others executed for the ſame fault, as they deſerve to be without ſighing. It falls out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that a perſon of good repute paſſes by the Gallows, and ſecretly ſobs within himſelf, while he ruminates theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:29880:168"/>in his mind: Lo, theſe poor wretches which totter in the air, as a ſcorn to others, and to us an object of ſadneſs, even after death pay for faults committed in their life. And what crimes they were hanged for? ſome of them perchance, if all their theivery were put together, have not ſtoln above ten or twelve ſhillings: Whereas thou who haſt purloined ſome thouſands of crowns, walks at thy liberty, clothed in Silk and Sattin; and art honourably treated by all, having perhaps been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in their death, which thy ſelf deſerved a hundred times more then they; who filcht away trifles, and hang for them; thou having carried away bags of Gold, and yet goeſt ſcot-free. Take heed: the Gods (ſaid the Ancients) tread upon Wooll with a ſlow pace, but in the end they recompenſe their ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſharpneſs of revenge.</p>
                  <p>In this manner muſt we employ our thoughts, when we meditate on hell: Alas! how many mortal ſins have I committed, and yet feel no ſmart of burning? How many fry in thoſe flames of Hell, and muſt fry for ever, who are guilty of far fewer crimes then I, and perhaps had commited but one deadly
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:29880:169"/>ſin? The Sun of Gods bounty yet ſhines upon me; they, whoſe ſins were neither ſo many nor grievous, as mine, are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in eternal darkneſs. Take heed: Gods vengeance creeps on with a ſlow, but ſure pace. Thou ſtands upon a tickle point, and doſt thou not tremble? a ſmall matter will throw thee down; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit thou haſt kept footing long, yet a moment ſerves to turn up thy heels: and then whither wilt thou fall? An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſſe and Chaos of flames will bid thee welcome. Take heed: If thou ſtir up a finger, thou falleſt; one ſmall Feavour, an Apoplexie, or Palſey; one ſlender prick with a Rapier, or Piſtol-bullet will ſend thee packing into Eternity. If when thou falleſt, thou be a friend of God, his Angels will bear thee up: If otherwiſe, the Devils will ſnatch thee away, and hell fire will give thee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was of opinion that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance many were condemned to Hell for one ſole mortal ſin, either of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, deſire of Revenge, ſome Lacivious thought, or ſome other way in thought, word or deed.</p>
                  <p>We may here ſeriouſly reflect, that many of the damned were men as well
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:29880:169"/>as we, and amongſt thoſe many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who by Sacraments and Sermons, by pious books and wholeſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions were induced to a vertuous life, which perhaps for ſome time they continued, even in great familiarity with God: but by degrees growing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and remiſs, they fell into mortal ſin, and ſo by Gods juſt judgement were condemned to eternal flames.</p>

Ah! how often and ſeriouſly do we engage to do great matters, but in effect paſs no farther then to a bare engagement; we fall out with our former bad courſes, we profeſs perpetual enmity with unchaſt familiarity, and ſtill wallow in the ſame puddle of impurity; we frequently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe amendment, and thats even all: we are big with mighty reſolutions, and when the time comes bring forth a little Mouſe, that is, a ſmall tepid and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary work.</p>

All which they reſolved firſt to deduce but of <hi>Plato's</hi> principles, and afterwards

This was their covenant, to which they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conſented and confirmed it by Oath. In proceſs of time they were ſo parted, as that they ſetled their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in different Cities. Which done, <hi>Michael Mercatus</hi> being early one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning buſiy at his ſtudy of Philoſophy, he heard a horſeman in the next ſtreet poſting amain towards his Gates, and <hi>Marſilius</hi> his voice calling aloud:

                  <p>AN attentive meditation on eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the beginning of a better life. Vertue is commended but coldly where love of eternal life is wanting.

                  <p>Theſe things we both know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, and yet we loyter, and neglect our chiefeſt good. Tis true, you may hear ſome ſay; O Eternity! But in the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:29880:176"/>interim they cheerfully lay faſt hold on a full cup, and carouſe ſo long, till the liquor damm at the top of their throat Now and then with a deep ſigh we breath out Eternity, and in the mean while our heart ſwimms in impure and lacivious thoughts; it digeſts ſecret luſt, and by hidden contrivances ſteals away it ſelf from God. We run in queſt after the treaſures of Heaven, but ceaſe not to ſmile upon money, which is the ſcum of the earth, and privately offer ſacrifice to <hi>Mammon.</hi> We make a ſhew, as if we were afraid of flames eternal, and yet hold on to kindle in our own boſoms the coals of wrath and envy. We gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily expect everlaſting repoſe, but ſtill continue our ſloathful courſes; as if we meant to make a buſineſs of idleneſs, and when induſtry is required to falter in the very onſet.</p>
                  <p>O we men, who do not offer violence to Heaven! But rather, O we blind men, who chooſe rather to erre in the broad and ſmooth way, then to go right in the rough and narrow!</p>
                  <p>Chriſt and his Saints call upon us: <hi>Strive to enter by the narrow gate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. ch. 13.</note> ſtrive, ſtrive, <hi>Becauſe many ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Make haſt, run, we

And God grant we go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and do not rather ſtand ſtill!</p>
                  <p>Our reſolutions and purpoſes are like to the feeble endeavours of one Sick: who now and then raiſeth himſelf up, crawls off his bed, and attempting to go, points his foot to the ground, and ſtrives to walk; but by and by for want of ſtrength falls upon his bed again: his Thighes and Legs are far too weak to bear the weight of his body: he would fain take a turn but is not able. Not much unlike are our endeavours; we deſign great matters, we attempt many things, we reſolve to become Saints, we ſeem to have a will to do gallantly. But theſe attempts are frivelous without ſtrength, we want alacrity of ſpirit, we languiſh in all our actions. Whence we willingly ſlide back into our former vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which we only intermitted for a time; but did not quite abandon. Thus we fall down again upon our bed, which we were about to leave, and are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with our old Lethargy.</p>

                  <p>We read over the Legends of Saints, and extol them; but follow them not, nor imitate them at all. We honour vertue with ſpecious titles, but expreſs it not in our actions: we gape after a bleſſed Eternity but ſhun with all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs the troubleſome way which leads us to it.</p>
                  <p>After Prayers are ended, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is paſt, we pack home, ſit down to table, and within a ſhort ſpace renew our old cuſtoms. It is our faſhion, to go to Church, to hear a Sermon, to fetch now and then a ſigh, which may manifeſt we are fallen out with our ſins, and are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with our ſelves for ſining. But how long I pray is this faſhion in requeſt? Almoſt in the turning of your hand all our former Sanctity is joyfully buried in oblivion. We do ſomething tis true; but that with extream tepidity: and ſo what we do is either worth nothing, or very imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Whence it falls out, that after ſix hundred Sermons we are no better, then before: we ſwear as we did, we are as impatient as ever, Luſt, Envy and wrath have as much power over us, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

                  <p>O ſtrange blindneſs of mankind, which with an Ocean of tears may not be ſufficiently deplored! the Pulpit in every Church rings with Eternity, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Eternity: and yet we are drawn away with pleaſures preſent, ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire we have of our own Perdition.</p>

Two intimate friends, quoth he, there were; you may call one of them <hi>Theſeus,</hi> the other <hi>Pirithous,</hi> which were almoſt as one Soul in two Bodies. Both of them lead an upright life; both loved each other ſo tenderly, and were ſo agreed amongſt themſelves, as that they deſired nothing more then to dy together. But Death croſt their agreement, and diſſolved their amity, by diſpatching one out of this life before the other. However all their familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not be extinct by death: For not long after they were parted, he that was dead appeared to his ſurviveing friend, both in habit and countenance compoſed to ſadneſs, as if he meant he ſhould ask him ſome queſtion.

In anſwer to which demands the dead man fetching a deep ſigh, repeared thrice in a diſtinct but mournful tone, theſe words: No one beleives no one beleives, no one beleives. The other with trembling asked again, what that

                     <hi>The world promiſeth temporal and ſmall things, and is ſerved with great diligence: Chriſt promiſeth moſt high and eternal things, and the hearts of men are nothing moved with it.

                     <hi>Francis Borgia</hi> Duke of <hi>Gandia</hi> being brought low by a hot Feavour, learned this leſſon, that in humane affairs there was nothing permanent, nothing perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Another time when this Feaver was ſo rageing, that his marrow ſeemed to boyl within the bones, this pious thought poſſeſt his mind: What flames ſcorch them, who for their crimes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain eternal torments? This thought was of ſingular uſe to him all the reſt of his life. A thought indeed moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether we be oppreſt with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or environed with other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: ſince, what is burdenſome to the body; ſerves to inſtruct the Soul.</p>

<note place="margin">Serm. de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordiis &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimis noſtrss.</note> who goes on through proſperity in this life to perdition. And truly it is a dangerous vanity to wiſh long life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking which way to live better.

                  <p>The ready way to Hell is by Luxury

                  <p>O night!

                     <hi>You may be pleaſed to take notice, my friend, that none can lye hid from that All-ſeeing and watchful eye, no, not in the moſt ſecret retreat if you do any thing amiſs: For all things are naked and open to him, though they ſeem to be never ſo private, and out of ſight.

                  <p>This fire alas! may not with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of years, nor as St. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> ſpeaks, with any numberleſs number of ages be extinguiſht. What way ſoever you turn, all is Fire, Pitch, Brimſtone, Anger, and Wrath of our Lord. Where you may note amongſt our fires a main difference; that of the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt being more active, then our uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fire; and that eternal, devouring fire of hell more powerful then either. Now let me demand with Eſay:

                     <hi>Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? which of you ſhall dwell with everlaſting heats?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What fiery Salt-Sea, though it be hot night and day, yet in the year it hath its intermiſſion from heat ſeveral dayes, when it remains quiet and free from burning, In Hell after an hundred, a thouſand, yea ten thouſand years are paſt,
<note place="margin">Tom. 9. trac. 5. de met.</note> not one day nor minute of reſpite will be allowed. <hi>He,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, who hath, a ſound conſideration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives what God hath revealed, fears more
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:29880:187"/>eternal fire, then the Sword of any Tyrant, though never ſo barbarous: He dreads more perpetual death, then any death here whatever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many houres then, how many moneths or years muſt thoſe Traitours to God abide in that fire? Neither hours dayes, nor years may be numbred: the hours ſhall be eternal, the dayes and moneth eternal, the years and fire ſhall be eternal. <hi>Why will God reject for ever?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 76.</note> He will reject for ever: <hi>The triumpher in</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not ſpare,</hi>

There is no ſight either in Heaven or Earth, which the dark ſome conſcience would rather avoid, but cannot. Darkneſs is not covered from its ſelf; it beholds it ſelf, that can diſcover nothing elſe. The works of darkneſs follow them, they can hide themſelves no where from darkneſs, no not in darkneſs it ſelf. This is the worm that dyeth not, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of things paſt; which being once caſt into, or rather bred in the ſoul by ſin, ſticks ſo faſt, that henceforth it can never be pluckt away. It doth not ceaſe to gnaw the conſcience, wherewith being fed, as with inconſumptive food, it preſerves its life perpetually.</hi> Here the truth of thoſe words will experimentally appear: <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet it againſt thy face.</hi>

                  <p>It is irkſome to one that is ſick, and cannot ſleep, to hear no Clock, nor to be able to know how the time paſſeth. Hence one quarter ſeems as long as an hour, and an hour as long as a whole night: and yet after ſix or ſeven hours are gone, the little birds with chirping melody, welcome in the morning; the Sun by degrees riſes out of his dayly tomb, the feaveriſh heat remits, and a gentle ſlumber ſeiſes on the temples: all things that by approaching night grew worſe, by this time are become more mild: Anon ſome will come in to ask how the ſick man doth, and will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cheer him up with comfortable words, but alſo with other neceſſaries. Nothing of all theſe O my God! is to be found in Hell; no Day, no Sun, no Dew, no Morning, no Birds, but Devils, no refreſhment, not ſo much as a drop of water: there is perpetual darkneſs, everlaſting dolours, and butchery of Conſcience without end.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt a hundred thouſand men you ſhall ſcarce find one, who ſeriouſly endeavours to dive into theſe matters, or frequently ruminates them in his mind. Our life would be far otherwiſe, our manners would be reformed, if our

Whence it comes, that our Conſcience which was ſtrook deaf with vices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its hearing in torments; ſo much more ſharply now is it afflicted and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, by how much ere while it was lulled a ſleep in a drowſy ſecurity.

                  <p>THis world we live in is repleniſht with many afflictions, yet in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time all of them meet with an end. Such as are oppreſt with poverty, I ſee find an end of it: ſuch as are aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſlanders, are cleared of them in the end: ſuch as are ſick, are in the end delivered of their malady. On this ſide I behold ſtripes, racks, and other engines prepared to torture: on that, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty enemies, proud Citizens, gripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Landlords; but I likewiſe behold the ſtroke of death brings all thoſe to nothing, and frees theſe from barbarous uſage.</p>
                  <p>But in thoſe fiery Gulfs where Devils abide, I contemplate many horrid and unexplicable torments; yet I cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy any end of them, no, there is no end at all to be found.

There ſhall be pain intollerable, horrible fear, and ſtink incomparable, death both of ſoul and body, without hope either of pardon or mercy. And yet ſhall they ſo dye as that they ſhall alwaies live; and ſo live; as that they ſhall ever dye. Thus the ſoul of a ſinner is either in hell tormented for ſins, or for good works placed in Paradiſe. Now therefore let us chooſe one of the two, either to be for ever tormented with the wicked, or to rejoyce with Saints perpetually. For good and evil, life and death are ſet before us, that we may ſtretch forth our hand to which we chooſe. If pains do not terrify us, at leaſt let rewards invite us.</hi>

                  <p>But alas! how great want of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found amongſt men, how great blindneſs! we wrangle for a half penny, and make a laughter and jeſt on't to loſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Thus we are infected with the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contagion of madneſs, and take pleaſure to periſh for company. <hi>Doſt thou not bluſh</hi> (ſaith St. Chryſoſtome) <hi>to be ſo wedded to things preſent? When wilt thou part with thy youth toyes, and lay a ſide thy wonted folly? What ever is here troubleſome, is of ſmall continuance; what is delightful there, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting. Remove therefore thy mind from tranſitory and fading goods, and ſettle it on

                     <hi>Thoſe puniſhments therefore</hi> (ſaith Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus) <hi>ought to have the firſt place in our thoughts, where man lives while the pain laſts; where neither pains are wanting to the body, nor the body to pains.</hi> To the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent writes St. Chryſoſtome: <hi>If the</hi> Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>had not been afraid of deſtruction,</hi>

If the</hi> Sodomites <hi>had dreaded the fire, they had not been burned. It is a great miſery to contemn menaces. Nothing is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as frequently to treat of hell: ſpeak of it every day, that you may never fall into it. A ſoul ſolicitous to eſcape hell, cannot eaſily commit ſin. None of thoſe, who have a lively remembrance of hell will fall into it: as none who ſleight hell, will eſcape it.</hi>

                  <p>A certain man (as <hi>Iohn Moſcus</hi> relates) came to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prat. ſpur. c. 141.</note> a venerable perſon, who governed the Monaſtery of Abbot <hi>Geraſimus,</hi> and ſaid unto him: <hi>Father, I have a deſign to flit from my old habitation, becauſe the unpleaſant ſituation of it is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to me.</hi> To whom the good old man ſpoke in this manner: <hi>Son this is a manifeſt ſign, you never conſider with attention either
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:29880:196"/>the joyes of heaven, or the pains of hell: for if you did ſeriouſly weigh theſe things in your mind, beleive me you would find no fault with your old habitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This was an Oracle of truth: for who ever meditates attentively on heaven or hell, either is not ſenſible of difficulty, though never ſo great; or if he be, he makes his benefit of it, and is moſt ready to undergo greater hardſhips, ſo he may avoid eternal pains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this temper was Abbot <hi>Olympius</hi> (as <hi>Clymacus</hi> teſtifies) who being asked how he could abide to live in ſuch a Cave, how he could endure ſuch exceſſive heats, or paſs ſo many daies amongſt whole ſwarms of gnats and flies? he returned this anſwer: <hi>I ſuffer theſe things willingly, that I may be freed from future torments: I am content to be bitten with gnats, becauſe I am afraid of the worm that never dyes: heat is welcome to me, in regard I ſtand in fear of fire everlaſting: for thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings paſs away with time, and will quickly have an end, but theſe are without end and continue for eternity.</hi>

                     <hi>Wherefore theſe things deſerve our dayly conſideration, and ought to be ruminated when our thoughts are moſt active. As Phyſick is taken by way of prevention, even when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is well in health: ſo likewiſe muſt our ſoul be prepared with theſe conſiderations to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand vice. I confeſs theſe thoughts are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:29880:197"/>bitter, but they are wholeſome too: they do not become familiar upon a ſuddain, but by degrees; time, place and practiſe will nouriſh, and bring them to maturity. All idleneſs is a ſworn enemy unto them, which as it is perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vertue ſo it opens an eaſy paſſage to let in all kind of vices.</hi>
